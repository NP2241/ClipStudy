00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:15,760
This guy, Grothendieck, is somewhat of a mathematical idol to me,

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,880
and I just love this quote, don't you?

00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,379
Too often in math, we dive into showing that a certain fact is true

00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,299
with a long series of formulas before stepping back and making sure it feels reasonable,

00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,340
and preferably obvious, at least at an intuitive level.

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,793
In this video, I want to talk about integrals,

00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:38,860
and the thing that I want to become almost obvious is that they are an inverse of derivatives.

00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,125
Here we're just going to focus on one example,

00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,198
which is a kind of dual to the example of a moving car that I talked about in chapter

00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,140
2 of the series, introducing derivatives.

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,619
Then in the next video we're going to see how this same idea generalizes,

00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,060
but to a couple other contexts.

00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,849
Imagine you're sitting in a car, and you can't see out the window,

00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,520
all you see is the speedometer.

00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,632
At some point the car starts moving, speeds up,

00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:10,740
and then slows back down to a stop, all over the course of 8 seconds.

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,212
The question is, is there a nice way to figure out how far you've

00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:18,960
travelled during that time based only on your view of the speedometer?

00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,029
Or better yet, can you find a distance function, s of t,

00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:27,498
that tells you how far you've travelled after a given amount of time, t,

00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:29,580
somewhere between 0 and 8 seconds?

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's say you take note of the velocity at every second,

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,100
and make a plot over time that looks something like this.

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,150
And maybe you find that a nice function to model that velocity

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,540
over time in meters per second is v of t equals t times 8 minus t.

00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:51,786
You might remember, in chapter 2 of this series we were looking at

00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:55,253
the opposite situation, where you knew what a distance function was,

00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:58,720
s of t, and you wanted to figure out the velocity function from that.

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,500
There I showed how the derivative of a distance vs.

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,860
time function gives you a velocity vs.

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,600
time function.

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,615
So in our current situation, where all we know is velocity,

00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:12,220
it should make sense that finding a distance vs.

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,433
time function is going to come down to asking what

00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,340
function has a derivative of t times 8 minus t.

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,364
This is often described as finding the antiderivative of a function, and indeed,

00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:27,300
that's what we'll end up doing, and you could even pause right now and try that.

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,641
But first, I want to spend the bulk of this video showing how this question is related

00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,421
to finding the area bounded by the velocity graph,

00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,345
because that helps to build an intuition for a whole class of problems,

00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:42,180
things called integral problems in math and science.

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,885
To start off, notice that this question would be a lot easier

00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:48,740
if the car was just moving at a constant velocity, right?

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,153
In that case, you could just multiply the velocity in meters per second times the amount

00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:58,940
of time that has passed in seconds, and that would give you the number of meters traveled.

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,160
And notice, you can visualize that product, that distance, as an area.

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,820
And if visualizing distance as area seems kind of weird, I'm right there with you.

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,848
It's just that on this plot, where the horizontal direction has units of seconds,

00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:17,467
and the vertical direction has units of meters per second,

00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,840
units of area just very naturally correspond to meters.

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,742
But what makes our situation hard is that velocity is not constant,

00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:28,480
it's incessantly changing at every single instant.

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,231
It would even be a lot easier if it only ever changed at a handful of points,

00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:39,626
maybe staying static for the first second, and then suddenly discontinuously

00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:43,849
jumping to a constant 7 meters per second for the next second, and so on,

00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,160
with discontinuous jumps to portions of constant velocity.

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,209
That would make it uncomfortable for the driver,

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,357
in fact it's actually physically impossible, but it would make your calculations

00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,740
a lot more straightforward.

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,958
You could just compute the distance traveled on each interval by multiplying the constant

00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:07,900
velocity on that interval by the change in time, and then just add all of those up.

00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,075
So what we're going to do is approximate the velocity function as if it

00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:17,243
was constant on a bunch of intervals, and then, as is common in calculus,

00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:21,579
we'll see how refining that approximation leads us to something more precise.

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,740
Here, let's make this a little more concrete by throwing in some numbers.

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,673
Chop up the time axis between 0 and 8 seconds into many small intervals,

00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:38,040
each with some little width dt, something like 0.25 seconds.

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,920
Consider one of those intervals, like the one between t equals 1 and 1.25.

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,682
In reality, the car speeds up from 7 m per second to about 8.4 m per

00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:53,893
second during that time, and you could find those numbers just by

00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:58,360
plugging in t equals 1 and t equals 1.25 to the equation for velocity.

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,071
What we want to do is approximate the car's motion

00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,580
as if its velocity was constant on that interval.

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,566
Again, the reason for doing that is we don't really know

00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:11,700
how to handle situations other than constant velocity ones.

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,720
You could choose this constant to be anything between 7 and 8.4.

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,240
It actually doesn't matter.

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,536
All that matters is that our sequence of approximations,

00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:28,040
whatever they are, gets better and better as dt gets smaller and smaller.

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,486
That treating this car's journey as a bunch of discontinuous jumps

00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:36,289
in speed between portions of constant velocity becomes a less-wrong

00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,980
reflection of reality as we decrease the time between those jumps.

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:50,845
So for convenience, on an interval like this, let's just approximate the speed with whatever the true car's velocity is at the start of that interval,

00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:54,640
the height of the graph above the left side, which in this case is 7.

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,118
In this example interval, according to our approximation,

00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:03,560
the car moves 7 m per second times 0.25 seconds.

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,780
That's 1.75 meters, and it's nicely visualized as the area of this thin rectangle.

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,440
In truth, that's a little under the real distance traveled, but not by much.

00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,920
The same goes for every other interval.

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:27,840
The approximated distance is v of t times dt, it's just that you'd be plugging in a different value for t at each one of these, giving a different height for each rectangle.

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,526
I'm going to write out an expression for the sum of

00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,340
the areas of all those rectangles in kind of a funny way.

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,121
Take this symbol here, which looks like a stretched s for sum,

00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,181
and put a 0 at its bottom and an 8 at its top,

00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:48,000
to indicate that we'll be ranging over time steps between 0 and 8 seconds.

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,400
And as I said, the amount we're adding up at each time step is v of t times dt.

00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
Two things are implicit in this notation.

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,340
First of all, that value dt plays two separate roles.

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,263
Not only is it a factor in each quantity we're adding up,

00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:08,780
it also indicates the spacing between each sampled time step.

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,465
So when you make dt smaller and smaller, even though it decreases the area of

00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:18,126
each rectangle, it increases the total number of rectangles whose areas we're adding up,

00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:21,740
because if they're thinner, it takes more of them to fill that space.

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,100
And second, the reason we don't use the usual sigma notation to indicate a sum is that

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,260
this expression is technically not any particular sum for any particular choice of dt.

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,420
It's meant to express whatever that sum approaches as dt approaches 0.

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,460
And as you can see, what that approaches is the area bounded by this curve and the horizontal axis.

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,754
Remember, smaller choices of dt indicate closer approximations for the original question,

00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,740
how far does the car actually go?

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,464
So this limiting value for the sum, the area under this curve,

00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:03,260
gives us the precise answer to the question in full unapproximated precision.

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,540
Now tell me that's not surprising.

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,497
We had this pretty complicated idea of approximations that

00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,760
can involve adding up a huge number of very tiny things.

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,200
And yet, the value that those approximations approach can be described so simply,

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,560
it's just the area underneath this curve.

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,112
This expression is called an integral of v of t,

00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:28,960
since it brings all of its values together, it integrates them.

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,820
Now at this point, you could say, how does this help?

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,511
You've just reframed one hard question, finding how far the car has traveled,

00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:42,440
into an equally hard problem, finding the area between this graph and the horizontal axis.

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,780
And you'd be right.

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,255
If the velocity-distance duo was the only thing we cared about, most of this video,

00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:54,240
with all the area under a curve nonsense, would be a waste of time.

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,260
We could just skip straight ahead to finding an antiderivative.

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,766
But finding the area between a function's graph and the horizontal axis is somewhat of a common language for many disparate problems that can be

00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:11,240
broken down and approximated as the sum of a large number of small things.

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,836
You'll see more in the next video, but for now I'll just say in

00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:19,115
the abstract that understanding how to interpret and how to

00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:22,940
compute the area under a graph is a very general problem-solving tool.

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,094
In fact, the first video of this series already covered the basics of how this works,

00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:31,229
but now that we have more of a background with derivatives,

00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:33,320
we can take this idea to its completion.

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,580
For a velocity example, think of this right endpoint as a variable, capital T.

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,830
So we're thinking of this integral of the velocity function between 0 and T,

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,417
the area under this curve between those inputs,

00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,220
as a function where the upper bound is the variable.

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,900
That area represents the distance the car has travelled after T seconds, right?

00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,300
So in reality, this is a distance vs.

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,280
time function, s of t.

00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,820
Now ask yourself, what is the derivative of that function?

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,324
On the one hand, a tiny change in distance over a tiny change in time is velocity,

00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:14,020
that is what velocity means.

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,139
But there's another way to see this, purely in terms of this graph and this area,

00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,180
which generalizes a lot better to other integral problems.

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,855
A slight nudge of dt to the input causes that area to increase,

00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:31,700
some little ds represented by the area of this sliver.

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,131
The height of that sliver is the height of the graph at that point,

00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:38,940
v of t, and its width is dt.

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,297
And for small enough dt, we can basically consider that sliver to be a rectangle,

00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:50,680
so this little bit of added area, ds, is approximately equal to v of t times dt.

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,968
And because that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller dt,

00:10:56,968 --> 00:11:01,680
the derivative of that area function, ds, dt, at this point equals vt,

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,060
the value of the velocity function at whatever time we started on.

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,260
And that right there is a super general argument.

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,540
The derivative of any function giving the area under a graph like this is equal to the function for the graph itself.

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,440
So, if our velocity function is t times 8-t, what should s be?

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,700
What function of t has a derivative of t times 8-t?

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,767
It's easier to see if we expand this out, writing it as 8t minus t squared,

00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:37,680
and then we can just take each part one at a time.

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,920
What function has a derivative of 8t?

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,570
We know that the derivative of t squared is 2t,

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,912
so if we just scale that up by a factor of 4, we can see that the derivative

00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,300
of 4t squared is 8t.

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,660
And for that second part, what kind of function do

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,560
you think might have negative t squared as a derivative?

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,929
Using the power rule again, we know that the derivative of a cubic term,

00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,780
t cubed, gives us a square term, 3t squared.

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,220
So if we just scale that down by a third, the derivative of 1 third t cubed is exactly t squared.

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,942
And then making that negative, we'd see that negative

00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:21,020
1 third t cubed has a derivative of negative t squared.

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,168
Therefore, the antiderivative of our function,

00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:30,920
8t minus t squared, is 4t squared minus 1 third t cubed.

00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,160
But there's a slight issue here.

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,915
We could add any constant we want to this function,

00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:41,020
and its derivative is still 8t minus t squared.

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,500
The derivative of a constant always goes to zero.

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:53,820
And if you were to graph s of t, you could think of this in the sense that moving a graph of a distance function up and down does nothing to affect its slope at every input.

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,641
So in reality, there's actually infinitely many different

00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:02,987
possible antiderivative functions, and every one of them looks

00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:07,540
like 4t squared minus 1 third t cubed plus c, for some constant c.

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,782
But there is one piece of information we haven't used yet that will let

00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:17,160
us zero in on which antiderivative to use, the lower bound of the integral.

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,404
This integral has to be zero when we drag that right

00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:24,220
endpoint all the way to the left endpoint, right?

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,380
The distance travelled by the car between 0 seconds and 0 seconds is… well, zero.

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,845
So as we found, the area as a function of capital

00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,720
T is an antiderivative for the stuff inside.

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,069
And to choose what constant to add to this expression,

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:47,160
you subtract off the value of that antiderivative function at the lower bound.

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,600
If you think about it for a moment, that ensures that the integral from the lower bound to itself will indeed be zero.

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,471
As it so happens, when you evaluate the function we have here at t equals zero,

00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,240
you get zero.

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,220
So in this specific case, you don't need to subtract anything off.

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,500
For example, the total distance travelled during the full 8 seconds

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,940
is this expression evaluated at t equals 8, which is 85.33 minus 0.

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,060
So the answer as a whole is 85.33.

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,460
But a more typical example would be something like the integral between 1 and 7.

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,968
That's the area pictured here, and it represents

00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:34,020
the distance travelled between 1 second and 7 seconds.

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,146
What you do is evaluate the antiderivative we found at the top bound,

00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,680
7, and subtract off its value at the bottom bound, 1.

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,160
Notice, by the way, it doesn't matter which antiderivative we chose here.

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,560
If for some reason it had a constant added to it, like 5, that constant would cancel out.

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,080
More generally, any time you want to integrate some function, and remember,

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,762
you think of that as adding up values f of x times dx for inputs in a certain range,

00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:12,840
and then asking what is that sum approach as dx approaches 0.

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,313
The first step to evaluating that integral is to find an antiderivative,

00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:23,540
some other function, capital F, whose derivative is the thing inside the integral.

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,436
Then the integral equals this antiderivative evaluated

00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:31,940
at the top bound minus its value at the bottom bound.

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,460
And this fact right here that you're staring at is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,260
And I want you to appreciate something kind of crazy about this fact.

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,234
The integral, the limiting value for the sum of all these thin rectangles,

00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:49,516
takes into account every single input on the continuum,

00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,860
from the lower bound to the upper bound.

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,840
That's why we use the word integrate, it brings them all together.

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,507
And yet, to actually compute it using an antiderivative,

00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:04,580
you only look at two inputs, the top bound and the bottom bound.

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,560
It almost feels like cheating.

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:15,140
Finding the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all the information needed to add up the values between those two bounds.

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,340
That's just crazy to me.

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,419
This idea is deep, and there's a lot packed into this whole concept,

00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:25,400
so let's recap everything that just happened, shall we?

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,580
We wanted to figure out how far a car goes just by looking at the speedometer.

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,220
And what makes that hard is that velocity is always changing.

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,352
If you approximate velocity to be constant on multiple different intervals,

00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:43,849
you could figure out how far the car goes on each interval with multiplication,

00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,480
and then add all of those up.

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,639
Better and better approximations for the original problem correspond to

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,780
collections of rectangles whose aggregate area is closer and closer to

00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,980
being the area under this curve between the start time and the end time.

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,231
So that area under the curve is actually the precise distance

00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,140
traveled for the true nowhere constant velocity function.

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,546
If you think of that area as a function itself,

00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:15,939
with a variable right endpoint, you can deduce that the derivative

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,660
of that area function must equal the height of the graph at every point.

00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,760
And that's really the key right there.

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,112
It means that to find a function giving this area,

00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,400
you ask, what function has v of t as a derivative?

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,496
There are actually infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function,

00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:38,673
since you can always just add some constant without affecting the derivative,

00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:43,439
so you account for that by subtracting off the value of whatever antiderivative function

00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,100
you choose at the bottom bound.

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,980
By the way, one important thing to bring up before we leave is the idea of negative area.

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,540
What if the velocity function was negative at some point, meaning the car goes backwards?

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:08,080
It's still true that a tiny distance traveled ds on a little time interval is about equal to the velocity at that time multiplied by the tiny change in time.

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,072
It's just that the number you'd plug in for velocity would be negative,

00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:15,720
so the tiny change in distance is negative.

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,523
In terms of our thin rectangles, if a rectangle goes below the horizontal axis,

00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:25,597
like this, its area represents a bit of distance traveled backwards,

00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:29,789
so if what you want in the end is to find a distance between the car's

00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,100
start point and its end point, this is something you'll want to subtract.

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,840
And that's generally true of integrals.

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,046
Whenever a graph dips below the horizontal axis,

00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:44,980
the area between that portion of the graph and the horizontal axis is counted as negative.

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,090
What you'll commonly hear is that integrals don't measure area per se,

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,180
they measure the signed area between the graph and the horizontal axis.

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,047
Next up, I'm going to bring up more context where this idea of an integral and area under curves comes up,

00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,760
along with some other intuitions for this fundamental theorem of calculus.

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,363
Maybe you remember, chapter 2 of this series introducing the derivative

00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:13,815
was sponsored by The Art of Problem Solving, so I think there's

00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:18,345
something elegant to the fact that this video, which is kind of a duel to that one,

00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:21,420
was also supported in part by The Art of Problem Solving.

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,189
I really can't imagine a better sponsor for this channel,

00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:29,160
because it's a company whose books and courses I recommend to people anyway.

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,850
They were highly influential to me when I was a student developing a love for

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,887
creative math, so if you're a parent looking to foster your own child's love

00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:42,082
for the subject, or if you're a student who wants to see what math has to offer

00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:46,120
beyond rote schoolwork, I cannot recommend The Art of Problem Solving enough.

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,928
Whether that's their newest development to build the right intuitions in

00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:55,461
elementary school kids, called Beast Academy, or their courses in higher-level

00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:59,420
topics and contest preparation, going to aops.com slash 3blue1brown,

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,412
or clicking on the link in the description, lets them know you came from this channel,

00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,200
which may encourage them to support future projects like this one.

00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,673
I consider these videos a success not when they teach people a particular bit of math,

00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:17,770
which can only ever be a drop in the ocean, but when they encourage people

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,338
to go and explore that expanse for themselves,

00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:24,491
and The Art of Problem Solving is among the few great places to actually do

00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,420
that exploration.

      "summary": "Density is explained as the ratio of mass to volume, measuring how packed something is. The standard unit is kg/m\u00b3, with water having a density of 1000 kg/m\u00b3 or 1 g/cm\u00b3.",

      "summary": "Explains how air density varies with altitude, from 0.1 g/cm\u00b3 at surface to 0.004 g/cm\u00b3 at 10km altitude. This variation occurs due to the weight of atmosphere compressing lower layers.",

      "summary": "Explains how water's density changes with temperature, reaching maximum density at 4\u00b0C. Below 4\u00b0C, density decreases as water molecules form gaps, leading to ice floating.",

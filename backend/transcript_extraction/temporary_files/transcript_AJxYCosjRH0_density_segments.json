      "summary": "Density is explained as the ratio of mass to volume, measured in kg/m\u00b3. It represents how crowded or packed something is, with examples given for water (1000 kg/m\u00b3) and iron (7.8 g/cm\u00b3).",

      "summary": "The density of water varies with temperature, reaching maximum density at 4\u00b0C at 1 g/cm\u00b3. As temperature decreases, molecules generally come closer together, increasing density.",

      "title": "Air Density Variation",
      "summary": "The density of air varies with altitude due to the weight of the atmosphere above. Lower layers experience more pressure, resulting in higher density at lower altitudes.",

      "summary": "Unlike gases, water is nearly incompressible, maintaining consistent density despite high pressure variations in oceans. Even extreme pressures at ocean depths don't significantly change water's density.",

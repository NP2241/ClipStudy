00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome all my brainiacs to another class of your biology course for

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,379
our entrance exam to the National Polytechnic Institute today

00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:11,930
National Polytechnic Institute today we are in class number 7 and we

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,240
we are in class number 7 and we begin with module number 3 which

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,060
begin with module number 3 which talks about cellular transport the topic

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,700
talks about cellular transport the topic that we will see in this video is going to be

00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,460
that we will see in this video is going to be replication transcription and translation

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,510
replication transcription and translation of the adjective let's begin

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,220
of the adjective let's begin [Music]

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,750
[Music] Well to start talking about

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,380
Well to start talking about replication transcription and translation

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,470
nucleic acid is before we get into all the dm stuff well let's start with

00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:51,940
molecules are compounds of atoms okay if you put more

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,390
than two atoms together and depp they are stable they will form a molecule nucleic acids

00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,119
form a molecule nucleic acids are that a molecule now let's see

00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,590
what atoms it has but this molecule is very complex and it does have many many many

00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,830
nucleic acids for they are used to store

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,200
used to store genetic information remember

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,540
genetic information remember genetic information is that information that tells us what

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,570
genetic information is that information that tells us what our hair color is like our

00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,100
our hair color is like our skin color the size of our

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,310
ears  etcetera that is genetic information so nucleic acids

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,320
genetic information so nucleic acids are molecules that store

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,560
are molecules that store genetic information yeah and we're going to have two types

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,470
these two types one is DNA or known as

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,180
DNA or known as deoxyribonucleic acid here I put it in

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,010
deoxyribonucleic acid here I put it in capital letters so you're going to realize

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,010
capital letters so you're going to realize where its acronym DNA comes from acid here

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,560
where its acronym DNA comes from acid here is deoxyribonucleic acid m

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,700
deoxyribonucleic acid dna ribonucleic acid and here are the acronyms

00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,950
ribonucleic acid and here are the acronyms so our nucleic acids which

00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,570
so our nucleic acids which are complete are molecules that

00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,830
are complete are molecules that help us store information which

00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,249
help us store information which are dna and dna okay if you

00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,890
are dna and dna okay if you notice here this is the difference for a on

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,960
notice here this is the difference for a on average from m to tn they

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,220
are two comfortable little threads that have the middle in the middle these lines like this right now right

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,960
middle in the middle these lines like this right now right now we're going to see specifically it goes down

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,930
now we're going to see specifically it goes down and the air m is just a little thread it also

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,460
and the air m is just a little thread it also has the lines but here it's just a little

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:25,900
deoxyribonucleic acid and rna ribonucleic acid okay these

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,400
ribonucleic acid okay these nucleic acids we're going to see a  little bit of

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
nucleic acids we're going to see a  little bit of history Uruguay

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,060
history Uruguay Amy he discovered their

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,710
Amy he discovered their function to us he discovered through

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,540
function to us he discovered through experiments what the function of these

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,000
experiments what the function of these nucleic acids was from nm and d

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,460
nucleic acids was from nm and d he discovered that they carried

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,789
genetic information and I already told you the genetic information and this is what

00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,559
genetic information and this is what tells us what we are like our

00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:48,789
characteristics with our hair this our height our eye color

00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,220
our height our eye color etcetera he discovered that report that

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,380
etcetera he discovered that report that these nucleic acids stored that

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,899
these nucleic acids stored that genetic information and these two

00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:56,559
genetic information and these two characters

00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,559
characters Watson and Crick, what they did

00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,809
Watson and Crick, what they did was describe the current model of

00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,580
was describe the current model of DNA what does that mean they told us

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,039
DNA what does that mean they told us that DNA is like the currency very

00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,789
small that practically with the microscope it is still very difficult to

00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,250
microscope it is still very difficult to see they described this model they

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,619
see they described this model they said well let's see what two

00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,890
said well let's see what two helices are or two threads here there is one and

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,280
helices are or two threads here there is one and here there is another they are two helices with

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,319
here there is another they are two helices with nitrogenous bases now let's see what

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,089
nitrogenous bases now let's see what the nitrogenous bases are they are the ones in

00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:27,280
the nitrogenous bases are they are the ones in the middle yeah but you right now just

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,860
remember that DNA the model of DNA was described by four crit who

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,330
described by four crit who told us that there is a double helix and

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,920
told us that there is a double helix and nitrogenous bases well then I already told you

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
nitrogenous bases well then I already told you the  Nucleic acids are present in

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,509
the  Nucleic acids are present in all cells now I'm going to tell you

00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,730
all cells now I'm going to tell you the definition of nucleic acids

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,180
the definition of nucleic acids linear numbers of monomers called

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,650
linear numbers of monomers called nucleotides and I imagine we're all going to

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,540
nucleotides and I imagine we're all going to have this face I'm not sure what's up with that they

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,910
have this face I'm not sure what's up with that they are linear polymers of a number

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,040
are linear polymers of a number called nucleotide well let's

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,990
called nucleotide well let's develop this phrase then we already

00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,510
develop this phrase then we already know that nucleotides are DNA and

00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,230
know that nucleotides are DNA and MR

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,620
and here it tells us that they are polymers that are going to be formed by nucleotides what does it

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,720
going to be formed by nucleotides what does it mean let's see then what

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,610
a nucleotide is here it tells us that the implicit acid is like a line let's suppose we

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:19,449
see this as if it were DNA okay we have two helices but from my drawings

00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,100
two helices but from my drawings but it's so you can see it more

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,210
graphically remember that here we have these lines and these are in the middle

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,550
these lines and these are in the middle aha then this is a DNA ok then it

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,410
aha then this is a DNA ok then it says that it is a polymer

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:39,250
nucleic acid ok then it is a polymer that is formed by

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,730
polymer that is formed by nucleotides

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,600
let's see what a nucleotide is the nucleus has is a tiny part

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,600
nucleotide and when we put together  many like this linearly many many many we are going to

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,089
linearly many many many we are going to form a nucleic acid now let's

00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,070
form a nucleic acid now let's see what a nucleotide is a nucleotide is going to be

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,790
see what a nucleotide is a nucleotide is going to be formed by a phosphate group

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,129
an open sugar and a nitrogenous base look at this figure here the little

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:12,290
circle is going to be the phosphate group this sugar suction cup point pentagon what does

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,469
sugar suction cup point pentagon what does the pentagon sound like to you a geometric figure

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,719
the pentagon sound like to you a geometric figure the pentagon how many degrees does it have 5

00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,249
the pentagon how many degrees does it have 5 then here look for the figure that

00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,860
then here look for the figure that has 5 parts here there is one here there are two

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,779
has 5 parts here there is one here there are two here there are 3 that box that there are 5

00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:27,119
here there are 3 that box that there are 5 then it is a suction cup sugar

00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,609
then it is a suction cup sugar because because it is a pay attention to with 5 2

00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,729
because because it is a pay attention to with 5 2 with 5 carbons and then a nucleotide

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:40,529
sugar points to it the pentagon and a nitrogenous base this is the nitrogen base

00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:40,539
nitrogenous base this is the nitrogen base

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
287 00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560  and we have these several nitrogenous bases

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,610
and we have these several nitrogenous bases we live explain them okay

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:55,500
in the structure of DNA here we can see it in large size if we look at it

00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,879
see it in large size if we look at it closer and closer

00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,590
closer and closer look here here always in all that

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,750
look here here always in all that attention there comes the attention you already saw that

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,730
attention there comes the attention you already saw that here there is  a little ball that sounds like

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,790
the phosphate group already life here is a pentagon here it is seen more clearly in

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,460
pentagon here it is seen more clearly in exchange for both sides there is that is going to be

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,860
the suction cup sugar and the pentagon and here there are different shapes but look at this one this one

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,570
the nitrogenous bases and like the invention right now there are several

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,890
invention right now there are several nitrogenous bases that is why here there are several little

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,379
nitrogenous bases that is why here there are several little colors if in different ways it is almost

00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,500
colors if in different ways it is almost composed of DNA they are nucleotides

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,480
composed of DNA they are nucleotides this this set of these three

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:40,110
polymer or in other words they form a chain a line like this is how DNA is formed then

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:48,510
suction cup sugar the pentagon and puts a nitrogenous base that can be one of these

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,920
nitrogenous base that can be one of these figures

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,290
and you realize here what is joined is the nitrogenous base with another base of inter

00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,189
final to you already saw these are the ones that are joined the ones that are linked the suction cups and

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,680
joined the ones that are linked the suction cups and the phosphorus and the phosphate groups are the ones that

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
the phosphorus and the phosphate groups are the ones that are next to them are the little

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:23,040
formed by nucleotides which is a nucleotide the set of these three

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,800
nucleotide the set of these three molecules is a phosphate group a sugar sucker sucker

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,749
molecules is a phosphate group a sugar sucker sucker of a pentagon that

00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:30,089
of a pentagon that has five sides and a nitrogenous base

00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:34,800
let's look at it here closely in our DNA here we have our phosphate group

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,689
here we have our phosphate group our pentagon and our

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,089
our pentagon and our nitrogenous base this this set here

00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,730
nitrogenous base this this set here these three molecules are a nucleotide and

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,680
these three molecules are a nucleotide and if we put together many nucleotides we are going to

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,879
if we put together many nucleotides we are going to form

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,750
form DNA I hope that was clear

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,360
then well we already know that the phosphate group a and eta no the sugar sucker

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,790
phosphate group a and eta no the sugar sucker can be two types we can have two

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:03,920
dextrose there was already one that continues being the pentagon it still has the five sides

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,790
because each side because on each side there is a carbon here although we see an oxygen

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,270
a carbon here although we see an oxygen even so you have we take care 1 2 3  4 5

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,290
even so you have we take care 1 2 3  4 5 up to here the same 1 2 3 4 or 5 these two

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,300
up to here the same 1 2 3 4 or 5 these two molecules are almost the same almost

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,830
molecules are almost the same almost identical what is the only difference

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,130
identical what is the only difference this voce and this h

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,840
this voce and this h that is what changes the name and

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,450
many of its functions this is called ribose 1 h and this is called two

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,810
called ribose 1 h and this is called two sexes and shock if ribose let's

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,270
sexes and shock if ribose let's see here see this comes out well

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,360
see here see this comes out well here the dna and here comes the harness

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,760
here the dna and here comes the harness when we talk about dna we are going to say that it

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,650
when we talk about dna we are going to say that it has the nucleotide that has its

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,140
has the nucleotide that has its phosphate group it has its painful and it has its

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,470
phosphate group it has its painful and it has its base or troje anything but the suction cup base

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,910
base or troje anything but the suction cup base has to be one of these two when

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,610
has to be one of these two when making

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:54,620
451 00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,569  deoxyribonucleic if you notice

00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,490
deoxyribonucleic if you notice here we have oxygen and hydrogen and here

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,540
only hydrogen here we got rid of the hydrogen that's why its name oxygen

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,019
hydrogen that's why its name oxygen sorry what is its name shock if

00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:10,280
ribose meaning we get rid of the oxygen from that oxy ribose here there is no

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,689
oxygen from that oxy ribose here there is no oxygen in this then the only

00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:13,780
oxygen in this then the only difference that let in here then

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,150
difference that let in here then the dna has a phosphate group the little

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,699
the dna has a phosphate group the little circle and it has a suction cup which is the one

00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:22,460
circle and it has a suction cup which is the one of shocks and ribose  because they don't

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,499
of shocks and ribose  because they don't have oxygen here it is not necessary to turn

00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:25,519
have oxygen here it is not necessary to turn it on but I want you to

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,329
differentiate DNA and RM it is still a pentagon but it does not have the oxygen that it

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,009
pentagon but it does not have the oxygen that it should have here like in the ribota that is why it

00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,240
is shock if it overflows that is why it is deoxyribonucleic acid I hope

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,090
deoxyribonucleic acid I hope this is very clear well then in

00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,850
this is very clear well then in the air m we have the same the suction cup or

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,249
the air m we have the same the suction cup or the pentagon of the five sides and here

00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:55,700
been the click bond or the other way around if it has its demand or it is called ribose the sugar

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:05,630
here our DNA the DNA is made up of nucleotides the nucleotide

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,910
made up of nucleotides the nucleotide are these three molecules if we put together

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,770
are these three molecules if we put together many nucleotides it will give us a DNA or

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,760
airén then the entire nucleotide has a phosphate group it has a little ball it

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,100
a phosphate group it has a little ball it also has a painful it is the one with five

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,440
sides and it also has a nitrogenous base these here the painful ones

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,680
nitrogenous base these here the painful ones are going to be two yeah if we have this we are going

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,720
are going to be two yeah if we have this we are going to do to  dm and if we have this one we are going to

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,030
to do to  dm and if we have this one we are going to do rn because because the stinky one

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,850
do rn because because the stinky one apart from having five sides

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:42,080
five sides and the difference is that the beautiful one has h at this end and it is and

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,900
beautiful one has h at this end and it is and this one has only one h

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,680
so this one is called ribose and this one is called the strokes and from alive to because

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,000
called the strokes and from alive to because because here we got rid of the oxygen

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,730
because here we got rid of the oxygen of shocks and get rid of the oxygen of

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,920
of shocks and get rid of the oxygen of shocks and rhythms to because that way you are going to

00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,230
shocks and rhythms to because that way you are going to differentiate between rn and dna only goes

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,060
need because dna deoxyribonucleic acid because he warned that

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:09,879
ribonucleic why because it is a remora already

00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:09,889
565 00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,569  here we have our two our two

00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,879
here we have our two our two molecules our dna that remember that they

00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,129
molecules our dna that remember that they are two threads and our dna that

00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:25,660
phosphate group here is the yellow one the ball they have a suction cup sugar here

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,509
ball they have a suction cup sugar here are the purple ones the pentagons and now

00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:36,179
nitrogenous bases are various that is why there are many colors milestones here in the middle

00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,269
many colors milestones here in the middle in total  there are five okay but look here

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,309
in total  there are five okay but look here here we are going to compare we have at the top and

00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:52,980
cytokines and the DNA also has cytosine

00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:01,139
in the rm it has good then the DNA also has good RNA has I will make

00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,290
also has good RNA has I will make mines and the DNA also has a of mines that is to

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,670
say that between all its lines they have the three cytokines one in us and in addition

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,150
the three cytokines one in us and in addition these lines one line is one another

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:25,170
the difference the important one DNA has thymine and in the rm it has an asylum the air

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,210
thymine and in the rm it has an asylum the air will never have a low thymine it will always

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,400
will never have a low thymine it will always have a brazil or it has the three

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,769
have a brazil or it has the three nitrogenous bases cytokines guanine and

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,800
nitrogenous bases cytokines guanine and guess what but it also has an asylum there it does

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,810
guess what but it also has an asylum there it does not have shy or it does not have tyramine so that you

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,760
remember it goes the DNA if it has its aunt who is called thymine it is successful

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,800
its aunt who is called thymine it is successful without water or anything divine and shy but it does not

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,380
without water or anything divine and shy but it does not have an asylum then

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,180
have an asylum then to form our  nucleic acids

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,330
our dna and our dna we need to join them they join with these

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,840
sticks these sticks are the nitrogenous bases yeah let's see it like this for

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,810
mine and this red one let's see the red one here is red is the thymine so

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,640
red one here is red is the thymine so that it joins they always have to join in

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,350
that it joins they always have to join in pairs right now we'll see it but I want you to

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,300
pairs right now we'll see it but I want you to remember here we have five

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,630
remember here we have five nitrogenous bases low three are repeated in

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,480
nitrogenous bases low three are repeated in both in both structures in the dna rm

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,540
both in both structures in the dna rm but each one in it rn and the one that

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,480
but each one in it rn and the one that differentiates them is the last one

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,730
differentiates them is the last one

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,390
668 00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,570

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,790
670 00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,610

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,890
672 00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:37,900

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,230
thymine and brazil then the shy one where it is always in the dna and brazil or where it is always in the rm so our dna is made up of nucleotides which are these three a phosphate a painful and a nitrogen base of the hydrogenated base or five yeah but in the dna the last one and thymine and in the dna the last one is brazil there

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,480
thymine and in the dna the last one is brazil there cannot be thymine in the dna and there

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,120
cannot be thymine in the dna and there cannot be an asylum in  the dna 681 00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,030  then I told them that they had to

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,620
then I told them that they had to join for that which is that they had to

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,329
join for that which is that they had to join in order to join the chains

00:13:54,329 --> 00:14:03,290
guanine the green is always going to join with the cytosine with

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,880
always going to join with the cytosine with the blue or in other words you are always going to see

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,680
the blue or in other words you are always going to see green with blue but you know when we

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,270
green with blue but you know when we learn colors because nothing if they come

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,540
exactly but that is like this is graphic so that you remember

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,070
graphic so that you remember constitutional guanine I repeat many times

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,680
constitutional guanine I repeat many times marina situation to vanina situ but here we

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,350
have guanine successes and nothing then they are always going to join

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,850
always going to join here we have vanina success without then

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,190
always same week and then to nena adenine is in both it is also in

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,220
adenine is in both it is also in the rm and in the conscious ibm it will join

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,510
the rm and in the conscious ibm it will join with thymine in the case of dna and with

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,110
with thymine in the case of dna and with brazil or in the case of the rm

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,290
adenine always joins with the one that is different either with timid or like

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,660
different either with timid or like brazil or anima always constitutional and

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,360
brazil or anima always constitutional and guess with timid or in the case of the rm

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,010
guess with timid or in the case of the rm adenine with an asylum cage so now

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,110
adenine with an asylum cage so now we are going to summarize this the structure of

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,320
made up of nucleotides which are the set of three molecules phosphate group

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,190
set of three molecules phosphate group then there like nitrogenous base ok

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,750
then there like nitrogenous base ok when we talk about rn what

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,610
when we talk about rn what nitrogenous base changes

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:13,640
lines inside that change the activity and in the case of the suction cup

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,230
here we have ribose and here we have shocks and tribes that is what changes

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,140
shocks and tribes that is what changes here we are going to highlight this we already know

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,330
how the or said DNA is DNA is a very very long strip or rather it is too much too

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,040
a very very long strip or rather it is too much too big it is much much

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,400
big it is much much much

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,439
much so this here is a very

00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,210
so this here is a very small piece here I already eat millions and

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,710
small piece here I already eat millions and millions of nucleotides that are going to

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,290
millions of nucleotides that are going to join a piece of those nucleotides for

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,910
join a piece of those nucleotides for example this piece here is going to be

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,059
called people remember the whole strip is a nucleic acid a little piece or rather of

00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,949
a nucleic acid a little piece or rather of three molecules is a nucleotide and if

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:51,389
we put together a piece of all our DNA like this for example this is you connected

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,579
like this for example this is you connected this that is going to be a gene and now we are going to

00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,490
this that is going to be a gene and now we are going to see more specifically so look here we

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,360
have our DNA if I take this piece

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,980
if I take this piece this piece

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,190
this piece as I'm going to call it

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:13,770
all my strip is the DNA will allow it is a nucleic acid and as I have 22 strands it

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,860
a nucleic acid and as I have 22 strands it is DNA because it is dressed

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:24,030
little piece that will be 9 people to the genes are what give us our

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:30,030
little piece here can tell me the color of eyes this other little piece here

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,650
will tell me my height those are the genes define our

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,750
genes define our characteristics in this other little piece

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:47,460
color of hair this little piece here will define

00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,570
our skin color and so this little piece here will tell us another

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,400
little piece here will tell us another characteristic and so each little piece that

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,800
characteristic and so each little piece that we take like this in your example and

00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,860
the space that it occupies, that is to say, this space that is occupying within

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,250
space that is occupying within our DNA is called a locus, the locus

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:10,079
DNA just to give you an idea the human being has approximately 25

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,730
the human being has approximately 25 thousand genes so images of these

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,270
thousand genes so images of these little pieces

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,330
little pieces x  25,000 so our DNA is too

00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,350
too big in this this is just a little piece but the genes

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,840
is just a little piece but the genes the DNA are very long

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,970
the DNA are very long and we have many genes more than 25,000

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,700
and we have many genes more than 25,000 genes we have already seen our nucleotides

00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,410
genes we have already seen our nucleotides our children' nucleic we have already seen that

00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,480
our children' nucleic we have already seen that these are little pieces are genes and that all of

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,590
these are little pieces are genes and that all of this is our DNA I

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,970
this is our DNA I already told you our DNA is too

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,680
already told you our DNA is too too long so our

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,400
eukaryotes that want to save them like this vomit in their nucleus in their bag what are they

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,590
vomit in their nucleus in their bag what are they going to do as it is a very long very

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,360
going to do as it is a very long very long very long strip what they are going to

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,800
long very long strip what they are going to do is condense it squeeze it

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,970
do is condense it squeeze it squash it so that it becomes

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,470
squash it so that it becomes as small as possible and

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,260
as small as possible and fits in their nucleus ok it is going to condense

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,610
fits in their nucleus ok it is going to condense they deserve it is necessary that you

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:57,000
last image what are the histones the nuclei or more and etc right now no that is not

00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,050
nuclei or more and etc right now no that is not going to be asked so do not

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,260
worry the only important thing is that it is going to condense it is going to be small very

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,610
going to condense it is going to be small very small do you realize that

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:09,150
made like this smaller like a pearl necklace and then you make

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,270
little strips like this because these strips are literally millions and millions of little

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,660
literally millions and millions of little balls and they form this kind of x ok

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:24,420
millions and millions of nuclei god is x it is called chromosome chromosomes

00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,710
x it is called chromosome chromosomes remember this yes we are going to see it and

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,260
remember this yes we are going to see it and later on also the chromosomes are in

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,910
later on also the chromosomes are in the nuclei like this and we store

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,800
the nuclei like this and we store our dna in chromosomes

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,300
in these x's here now now yes guys we are going to make our own

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,530
dna because because the dna when it connects to

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,240
because because the dna when it connects to the cell when we want to make

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,100
the cell when we want to make more cells all the cells have to

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,850
the same information in the cells that we are going to make what our nucleus does is that

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,210
going to make what our nucleus does is that it is going to replicate or it is going to

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,160
it is going to replicate or it is going to make more dna so that one keeps it

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,720
make more dna so that one keeps it a cell and others now that they understand

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,410
a cell and others now that they understand that in skates it is almost festive

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,870
that in skates it is almost festive softer m has to copy it like

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,280
softer m has to copy it like make two then it is going to be

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,170
make two then it is going to be your work right now what you see

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,960
here is a chain of dna and here it was joined

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,850
joined here  It was joined to what happened was that we

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,770
here  It was joined to what happened was that we split it we split it in half

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,080
split it we split it in half because that's what our cell does it

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,370
because that's what our cell does it 's pretty let's see it we

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,810
's pretty let's see it we split it in half and we're going to create

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,480
split it in half and we're going to create two identical ones

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
two identical ones as we would do it as we would do it well

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,660
like this we already know if they are nitrogenous bases and that each one second and

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:39,049
divine one which is the divine one which is Havana and the islands and bacon we already

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,880
Havana and the islands and bacon we already know how each one joins with whom

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,490
know how each one joins with whom then here we are going to complete them well

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,810
then here we are going to complete them well then we are going to join we are going to make

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,830
then we are going to join we are going to make our chain okay

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,270
our chain okay we already split our DNA in

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,380
half and we have to make two DNA as we are as we would make ourselves well by

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,620
as we are as we would make ourselves well by joining the pairs others

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,510
joining the pairs others remember that this is once in

00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,670
remember that this is once in hydrogenated it is called a de mina with whom

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,289
hydrogenated it is called a de mina with whom the fortune teller asked

00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,570
the fortune teller asked with thymine then you already know you

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,399
with thymine then you already know you have half of a chain or rather

00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,259
have half of a chain or rather because this was in the DNA together but they

00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,649
split it and they tell you now with this half all this other half then they

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:12,570
half all this other half then they tell you that you have adenine and you say that

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,820
tell you that you have adenine and you say that UNESCO and look then what are you going to

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,100
put the fortune teller this is another  mine that you are going to put here

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,090
exactly now you have a thymine that you are going to put here

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,510
going to put here guess exactly here we have another

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,130
guess exactly here we have another thymine we

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,140
1043 00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,190  now have the guanine that joins

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:42,419
now have the guanine that joins the other

00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:42,429
1047 00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,140  vanine

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,890
vanine and last current situation very well have you already

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,520
realized that the 1054 00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,020

00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,180
1056 00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,130

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,660
1058 00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:02,670

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,780
air in which we made new is identical to the one that we had removed be happy that the only thing that we are going to do is duplicate them that is to say it is the same information on one side well it is not the same on this side as on this side rather instead if you cut them what you are going to put on this one is going to be the same that

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,740
you removed and the annoying class is the same that you removed and how do you know  in

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,270
same that you removed and how do you know  in the cell that is going to do it

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,490
the cell that is going to do it because it knows that each adenine joins with

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,200
because it knows that each adenine joins with timid each thymine with the divine each

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,790
timid each thymine with the divine each hill with cytokine and each

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,000
hill with cytokine and each current situation or at a level like that you know with

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,930
create all the DNA now ball the important thing since we see all this theory we

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,050
are going to then understand that the ray is the central dogma of

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,700
ray is the central dogma of biology

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,230
biology we are going to see works and as such the topic that we

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,060
had that we are seeing from the beginning we are talking about

00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,160
beginning we are talking about our nucleus our nucleus stores

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,290
our nucleus our nucleus stores our genetic information

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,520
when we want to have this a child we have to give them that

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,850
child we have to give them that genetic information yeah and combine it with that of their

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,160
genetic information yeah and combine it with that of their human father

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,630
then the DNA the nucleus and that has the DNA the DNA can have two doses of two

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,750
DNA the DNA can have two doses of two functions or two ways it can replicate or in other words

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,550
make another identical another DNA here it is replicated the DNA is replicated to

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,920
replicated the DNA is replicated to make another this when they go for example

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,520
make another this when they go for example of mitosis remember that a cell

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,910
of mitosis remember that a cell divides into two equal cells

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,200
divides into two equal cells if we are going to divide into two

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:25,180
be two equal these have  that have the same genetic information then

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,950
this one that is going to be here you have your DNA it is not going to be it is going to be two

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,020
not going to be it is going to be two identical ones, that is to say it is going to divide it is going to create

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,600
identical ones, that is to say it is going to divide it is going to create its nitrogenous bases and it is going to give one

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,180
its nitrogenous bases and it is going to give one each one and now yes now each one x

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,370
each one and now yes now each one x excuse my drawing each one has its

00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,450
nitrogenous base your excuse me your DNA is the same why because here it replicated that

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,080
is to replicate to make a replica it is like in the tremors when it says nothing and it

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,990
is that you have to be careful that it is archived and they can by the replicas that

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,190
archived and they can by the replicas that to see replicas or in other words that there may be

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,620
to see replicas or in other words that there may be another one equal to the DNA that makes it

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,750
another one equal to the DNA that makes it replicate towards another identical one for when they

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,160
replicate towards another identical one for when they want to divide and they want their daughter cells

00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,170
want to divide and they want their daughter cells

00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,160
1167 00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,430  the same information that is replication

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,210
the same information that is replication then the DNA can replicate ok it

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,450
then the DNA can replicate ok it can replicate here or it can take another

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,970
can replicate here or it can take another path which is the pathway of transcription and

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,860
path which is the pathway of transcription and translation what it wants to do this for is to

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,990
translation what it wants to do this for is to create proteins yeah remember that

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,430
create proteins yeah remember that DNA has all the information that

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,200
DNA has all the information that we need sometimes we are going to

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
we need sometimes we are going to need certain proteins to

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,830
need certain proteins to do something the cell says I'm going right now

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,780
do something the cell says I'm going right now I need a protein for whatever I want

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,400
I need a protein for whatever I want not for this to put a  molecule

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
not for this to put a  molecule says lula who has that information

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,690
nucleus and there is the dna there it has all the information there it says

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,240
there it has all the information there it says how to make those proteins aha but let's

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,880
how to make those proteins aha but let's imagine that the dna and the ribosomes

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,250
imagine that the dna and the ribosomes that are the ones that create the proteins we

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,130
that are the ones that create the proteins we saw yesterday in organelles the ribosomes

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,740
saw yesterday in organelles the ribosomes that create the proteins speak a different

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,010
language ok the dna here where it is in the nucleus

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,870
in the nucleus the nucleus of the cell and the ribosome

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,360
the nucleus of the cell and the ribosome speak a different language so they

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,500
speak a different language so they want Spanish and the ribosome speaks

00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,830
want Spanish and the ribosome speaks English

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,850
but the ribosome I want to make a protein you need in a protein

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,900
protein you need in a protein so here it has to tell it to

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,120
so here it has to tell it to give that information to the nucleus but well they

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,320
give that information to the nucleus but well they speak different languages ​​so

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,900
information if it sends it like that the ribosome is not going to understand anything because it is in

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,970
not going to understand anything because it is in English ok so what does

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,400
English ok so what does the dna have to do it has to do a transcription

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,920
the dna have to do it has to do a transcription which is the transcription that they do when

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:29,070
going to transcribe it to another one to a language that you understand aha so

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,660
language that you understand aha so as if the document here that

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,460
as if the document here that is sending the dna or rather  our

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,730
is sending the dna or rather  our our metal is in Spanish and all

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,750
our metal is in Spanish and all the English then you have to

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,350
the English then you have to transcribe to English

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,780
transcribe to English then the DNA can be transcribed and

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:50,799
RNA is going to convert from m&a to dmm and this is going to be called messenger RNA yeah

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,570
going to be called messenger RNA yeah then the DNA is transcribed to

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,850
then the DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA and this tool I want now they

00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,740
messenger RNA and this tool I want now they only have to be translated so that

00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,510
only have to be translated so that we saw the ribosome understand it it is only

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,120
we saw the ribosome understand it it is only translated now we can see the message we

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,669
translated now we can see the message we translate it works and we read it and we create

00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,850
our protein that is all that is all of transcription and

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,620
all of transcription and translation transcriptions that we

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,110
translation transcriptions that we transcribe or in other words we make from the DNA that we

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,510
transcribe or in other words we make from the DNA that we cannot read to the DNA we

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,620
convert it to rm because if we can read it here what we could not follow

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:25,070
thymine and this one has Brazil as it is born now yes we can read it we

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,510
born now yes we can read it we have to transcribe it change all

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,940
have to transcribe it change all the divine classrooms and lower them then

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,460
transcription convert DNA messenger RNA and translation read that

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,919
messenger RNA and translation read that messenger DNA to create the protein

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,990
messenger DNA to create the protein where in the ribosomes and well  Guys we

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,210
where in the ribosomes and well  Guys we come to today's question and

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,750
come to today's question and it tells us to identify the names of

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:51,859
1 and 2 of the process considered as the central dogma of biology in the scheme that

00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,840
central dogma of biology in the scheme that specifies the mechanisms of

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,119
genetic identity in the respective order section a translation and transcription section b

00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,039
translation and transcription section b transcription and translation section c

00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,470
transcription and translation section c reverse transcription and translation

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,409
reverse transcription and translation section of translation and

00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:16,700
correct order leave me the correct answer in the comments and don't forget to

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,919

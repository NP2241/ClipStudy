00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,310
okay let's uh let's start so hello everyone um welcome to

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,349
everyone um welcome to 1402 uh introduction to

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,950
1402 uh introduction to macroeconomics

00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,630
macroeconomics um I won't teach today so that's a good

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,709
um I won't teach today so that's a good news I will start on Wednesday so what I

00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,990
news I will start on Wednesday so what I want to today is essentially tell you

00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:47,069
about and uh also the rules of of the game so what a difference a single

00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:49,510
game so what a difference a single letter makes many of you must have taken

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,150
letter makes many of you must have taken 1401 in fact some of you may be taking

00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,189
1401 in fact some of you may be taking it concurrently it's a lecture right

00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:58,310
it concurrently it's a lecture right before mine and uh you know that's

00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,670
microeconomics 1401 this is macroeconomics and it doesn't take a lot

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,630
of imagination to realize that this course is about big things no we don't

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,749
course is about big things no we don't look at small things that's what micro

00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:17,190
firm at an industry ER in micro we don't do that we

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,990
industry ER in micro we don't do that we look at the whole economy we think about

00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,149
look at the whole economy we think about the us we think about China H we don't

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,950
the us we think about China H we don't think about an individual price we think

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,069
think about an individual price we think about inflation so the rate of change of

00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:31,109
O prices we don't think about whether a particular particular worker is employed

00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,109
or unemployed we think of whether the rate of unemployment is very high or low

00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,630
rate of unemployment is very high or low things of that kind okay when we look at

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,149
things of that kind okay when we look at two countries we look at the exchange

00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,950
two countries we look at the exchange rate which is a relative price of two

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,950
rate which is a relative price of two currencies not two individual Goods in

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,749
currencies not two individual Goods in two different countries but the whole

00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:47,590
two different countries but the whole currency and so on so that's what mcro

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,270
currency and so on so that's what mcro is about now you could think that mcro

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,149
is about now you could think that mcro is nothing else than the sum of lots of

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,429
micros no after all that's what an economy is made of a population a whole

00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:58,350
economy is made of a population a whole population is made of lots of

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,029
population is made of lots of individuals that can be analyzed with

00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,910
individuals that can be analyzed with the tools of 1401 and and the sequence

00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,590
the tools of 1401 and and the sequence that follows

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,350
1401 but that doesn't work and there are parallels in physics about this and so

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,270
parallels in physics about this and so on the way you want to study sort of big

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,790
on the way you want to study sort of big bodies is different from the way you

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,750
want to understand the movements of a small elements and and that's the case

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,990
small elements and and that's the case in macro maccro there's a big line of

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,550
in macro maccro there's a big line of research that has to do with the micro

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,030
research that has to do with the micro foundations of

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,390
foundations of macroeconomics but even in that case

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,630
macroeconomics but even in that case which is very close to micro

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,270
which is very close to micro ER most of the action end up happening

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,990
interactions in in the in the equilibrium aspects of the system so so

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,710
equilibrium aspects of the system so so it's a much more complicated object and

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,550
it's a much more complicated object and if you were to build it from the micro

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,309
if you were to build it from the micro it would be an incredibly complicated

00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,750
it would be an incredibly complicated object so one of the things we need to

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,190
object so one of the things we need to do in microeconomics is take some

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,750
do in microeconomics is take some shortcuts and and and that's what makes

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,750
shortcuts and and and that's what makes mcro a lot of an art it's not a science

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,070
mcro a lot of an art it's not a science per se it's some sort of a science it

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,509
has the tools of a science but it's a lot about shortcuts and tricks and so on

00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,309
lot about shortcuts and tricks and so on to capture the essence of a problem that

00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,589
to capture the essence of a problem that is very complex if you were to model it

00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:10,589
is very complex if you were to model it in in the all the Gory details okay and

00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:13,589
in in the all the Gory details okay and uh and in this course we're going to

00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,670
uh and in this course we're going to exagerate on that sense we're not going

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,949
exagerate on that sense we're not going to do anything complicated I promise you

00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,869
that some occas conceptually things will be complicated but the math will not be

00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,070
be complicated but the math will not be complicated okay uh so we want to keep

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,869
complicated okay uh so we want to keep things very very simple I want to

00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:29,910
things very very simple I want to communicate the essence of the big macro

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,710
communicate the essence of the big macro economic relationships this is not a PhD

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,190
economic relationships this is not a PhD course if you were to take a a PhD

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,030
course if you were to take a a PhD course in macro it would be a very mathy

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,429
course in macro it would be a very mathy type course in fact most of the people

00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,710
type course in fact most of the people that do apply micro in our PhD program

00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,429
that do apply micro in our PhD program complain against micro because they find

00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:46,270
complain against micro because they find it too mathy and so on okay but that's

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,309
it too mathy and so on okay but that's not going to be the case here that's not

00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:54,190
what this course is about my goal so if this is a successful

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,789
researcher in macro out of this hopefully you'll have a career

00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,550
hopefully you'll have a career eventually and do all the next steps

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,789
eventually and do all the next steps that you need to do that but I want you

00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:06,270
that you need to do that but I want you to be able to do is to read something

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,949
to be able to do is to read something like this this is a world economic

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,949
like this this is a world economic Outlook it's a publication that the IMF

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,710
Outlook it's a publication that the IMF puts out every six month in which it

00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,869
puts out every six month in which it tells you what how this sees the world

00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:17,270
tells you what how this sees the world and where we're heading and so on no

00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,349
and where we're heading and so on no equations there lots of tables and stuff

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,270
equations there lots of tables and stuff like that I'd like you to be able to

00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,230
like that I'd like you to be able to read that kind of document very clearly

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,710
read that kind of document very clearly I would like you to be able to read

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,150
I would like you to be able to read something say the Wall Street Journal

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,790
something say the Wall Street Journal and read it even critically some

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,189
and read it even critically some sometimes disagreeing with what's in

00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,749
sometimes disagreeing with what's in there Financial Times the economies

00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,230
there Financial Times the economies that's the goal of this course it's not

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,830
that's the goal of this course it's not a lot more than that it's just that if

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,469
a lot more than that it's just that if you do a summer internship in Wall

00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,029
you do a summer internship in Wall Street and you work in a macro hedge

00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,189
fund or whatever this is going to be a good course for that I mean this is what

00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:53,670
know that they don't but this that's a level of knowledge I not if it gets to

00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,110
level of knowledge I not if it gets to be very complicated I'm failing that's

00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,029
be very complicated I'm failing that's not what I want to do

00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,909
here the typical lecture again this is not a lecture the next the first lecture

00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,909
not a lecture the next the first lecture will be on Wednesday the typical lecture

00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:07,670
will be on Wednesday the typical lecture and not in the first part of the course

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,310
because you're not going to have the tools the definitions and so on to do it

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,230
tools the definitions and so on to do it what I want to do is is er spend five to

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,510
what I want to do is is er spend five to 10 minutes early on again the first part

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,830
10 minutes early on again the first part of the course we can't do that because

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,510
of the course we can't do that because you don't have still the knowledge to do

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,150
you don't have still the knowledge to do that but as as you start building tools

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,790
that but as as you start building tools I want to be able to sort of talk about

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,230
current events something that is happening out there that I find

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,990
happening out there that I find interesting or something I received that

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,070
morning may even the morning of the lecture in which I which I find

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,830
lecture in which I which I find interesting and if I think you already

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,950
interesting and if I think you already have the tools to begin to understand it

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,350
have the tools to begin to understand it I'm going to be repetitive I'm going to

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,390
I'm going to be repetitive I'm going to sort of come back to three four times to

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,070
sort of come back to three four times to the same topic hopefully you'll be know

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,710
the same topic hopefully you'll be know you'll be more advancing your knowledge

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,469
you'll be more advancing your knowledge in the later stages so you'll be able to

00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:55,350
understand it more and more okay so the typical lecture we have five to 10

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,189
typical lecture we have five to 10 minutes in which we'll talk about some

00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,830
minutes in which we'll talk about some facts something that is going on for

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,909
facts something that is going on for example a picture like this this is I

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:06,150
received it this morning I think this came from Goldman I think Goldman Sachs

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,629
came from Goldman I think Goldman Sachs yes and what you have in that picture

00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:19,870
you have two lines one of them is a measure of er wages wage growth

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,309
measure of er wages wage growth compensation to workers and another one

00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,550
compensation to workers and another one is a measure of inflation again all

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,629
is a measure of inflation again all those definition will come in the next

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,230
those definition will come in the next lecture and inflation so it's a rate at

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,870
lecture and inflation so it's a rate at which you know you must have heard about

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,230
inflation it's something prices are rising no and what that picture shows

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,790
rising no and what that picture shows you is that these two series are very

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,070
you is that these two series are very highly

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:44,150
correlated okay so when wage growth is high inflation tends to be high okay and

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,870
high inflation tends to be high okay and that's a big issue on these days there's

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:53,950
stuff so let me let me try to explain a little bit what is a concern on these

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,110
little bit what is a concern on these days

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,029
days again if you don't understand anything

00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,150
again if you don't understand anything doesn't matter if you don't understand

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,309
doesn't matter if you don't understand anything saying right now in the last

00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,309
anything saying right now in the last lecture then it matters but now it

00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,790
lecture then it matters but now it doesn't matter you know I'm just trying

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,589
doesn't matter you know I'm just trying to give you a flavor of the kind of

00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:07,909
to give you a flavor of the kind of things we'll be talking

00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:12,390
about that picture there again a variable that we'll Define in the next

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,749
lecture not now shows you the unemployment rate you don't need any

00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:19,189
unemployment rate you don't need any specific definition to know that to feel

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,110
at least get a sense that well if an employment is high workers aren't very

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,909
employment is high workers aren't very happy it's not a good thing to have lots

00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,110
happy it's not a good thing to have lots of unemployment and what that series

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,950
shows you the shaded areas are recessions in in the US what that series

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,430
recessions in in the US what that series shows you is that typically in

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,150
shows you is that typically in recessions unemployment goes up so

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,029
that's one of the features one of the main features of a recession is that

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:48,149
Great Recession as a parall for the Great Depression the US had the Great

00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:50,350
Great Depression the US had the Great Depression in the 30s this is the Great

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,550
Depression in the 30s this is the Great Recession the biggest sort of recession

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,749
outside of the Great Depression in the US and it's also known as the global

00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:01,830
financial crisis because this was a recession all around the world and what

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,950
recession all around the world and what you can see is that employment went very

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,110
you can see is that employment went very high that's a very feature a tell sign

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,589
high that's a very feature a tell sign of a of of a big recession and then it

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,309
of a of of a big recession and then it took a long time this was in in sort of

00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,189
took a long time this was in in sort of recovery covid was a massive shock to

00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:19,110
the labor market so not surprisingly an employment the employment rate is Spike

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,629
employment the employment rate is Spike there but then he also recover a lot

00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:24,070
there but then he also recover a lot faster than he recovered from that and

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,149
faster than he recovered from that and today we have unemployment rates that

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,350
today we have unemployment rates that are at historically low levels and

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,110
are at historically low levels and that's a big issue

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,269
that's a big issue the rate of unemployment in the US is at

00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,469
the rate of unemployment in the US is at historically low levels okay way below

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,269
what is normal forget recessions obviously way

00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,790
normal forget recessions obviously way below what is in happens in recession

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,790
below what is in happens in recession but even way below what is normal what

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,350
but even way below what is normal what happens dur normal times

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,550
happens dur normal times okay closely related to that is wage

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,590
okay closely related to that is wage growth I have just one measure of wages

00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,069
growth I have just one measure of wages there is a wage it's a it's a series of

00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:01,230
there is a wage it's a it's a series of wage that is that is particularly what

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,949
wage that is that is particularly what I'm about to say is particularly sharp

00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:07,990
which is the wages of in the accommodation and Food Service sectors

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,030
accommodation and Food Service sectors so wages have been rising very steadily

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,150
so wages have been rising very steadily and and very fast recently everywhere

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,470
and and very fast recently everywhere particularly in sectors like this you

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,910
particularly in sectors like this you where we have some problems what we call

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,150
where we have some problems what we call Labor Supply but we'll I'll get back to

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,710
that okay so those are two facts we have an employment at extremely low levels

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,550
an employment at extremely low levels and we have wage growth at a very high

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,389
and we have wage growth at a very high Fast Pace now that sounds wonderful no I

00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,030
Fast Pace now that sounds wonderful no I mean what else do you want an economy in

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,910
mean what else do you want an economy in which there's few people unemployed and

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,190
which there's few people unemployed and and the and the wages are growing a lot

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,190
and the and the wages are growing a lot I mean if this was micro this would be

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,949
I mean if this was micro this would be fantastic say okay look guy is employed

00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:47,710
and he's getting a high wage this is great well not so fast for

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,310
great well not so fast for macro not so fast because I already

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,829
macro not so fast because I already showed you in the first picture I show

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:54,030
showed you in the first picture I show you to motivate there's a connection

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,750
you to motivate there's a connection between wage growth and

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,389
between wage growth and inflation and that's what we're

00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,350
inflation and that's what we're experiencing the normal level of

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,509
inflation for an economy like the Us is around 2% that's normal that's what

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,829
around 2% that's normal that's what central banks Target in an economy like

00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,030
central banks Target in an economy like the US in the Euro area Japan has been

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,150
the US in the Euro area Japan has been dreaming with 2% but it hasn't been able

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,509
dreaming with 2% but it hasn't been able for decades to get it but although now

00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,190
they are but but they weren't for a couple of decades to get to 2% but

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,150
couple of decades to get to 2% but that's about and we will discuss later

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,670
that's about and we will discuss later in the course why 2% is about right for

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,389
in the course why 2% is about right for economies of the size of the US and so

00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,190
economies of the size of the US and so on obviously in recessions these things

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,949
on obviously in recessions these things can go low and that's why you know in

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:33,269
can go low and that's why you know in the covid recessions inflation went to

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,110
the covid recessions inflation went to zero

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,870
zero essentially but then it began to pick up

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,870
essentially but then it began to pick up and it's now at levels which are unheard

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,710
and it's now at levels which are unheard of in the US since the 80s okay so

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,269
of in the US since the 80s okay so depending on the particular measure you

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,949
depending on the particular measure you use of inflation is around 6 and a half%

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,910
use of inflation is around 6 and a half% to 8% that's the level of inflation we

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,870
have which is way way above what is considered a normal a reasonable Target

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,190
considered a normal a reasonable Target for the central banks for the inflation

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,269
okay so that's a problem we have had some good news recently in that

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,470
some good news recently in that inflation clearly picked already again

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,750
inflation clearly picked already again definition of inflation formal

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,350
definition of inflation formal definition inflation happens in the next

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,350
definition inflation happens in the next lecture but it already pick and it's

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,629
lecture but it already pick and it's declining but it's still at very very

00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,430
declining but it's still at very very high levels and that's a problem that's

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,590
high levels and that's a problem that's a big macroeconomic problem and one of

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,069
the things we want to understand in this course is well what to do about it how

00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,030
course is well what to do about it how do you do how do you deal with that what

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,470
do you do how do you deal with that what do central banks need to do in order to

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,350
do central banks need to do in order to deal with that now I've been talking

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,069
deal with that now I've been talking about the US but this is not specific to

00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:35,949
the US ER this episode this recovery from

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,910
US ER this episode this recovery from covid is is incredibly common across

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,790
different regions of the world I mean you see it everywhere with a few

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,990
you see it everywhere with a few exceptions and I'm going to talk about

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,870
exceptions and I'm going to talk about one major exception in a minute but but

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,470
it's it's it's it's WID spread it's a WID spread phenomenon that you know we

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,590
WID spread phenomenon that you know we had high employment then we had sort of

00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,670
had high employment then we had sort of very

00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,550
very high well I haven't told you that part

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,110
high well I haven't told you that part yet but then we have had sort of low

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,509
yet but then we have had sort of low inflation then inflation pick up

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,389
inflation then inflation pick up enormously and now we're all worried

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,790
enormously and now we're all worried about this very high levels of inflation

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,110
about this very high levels of inflation in

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,550
in fact if you look at sort of what

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,230
fact if you look at sort of what happened between the Great Recession and

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,750
happened between the Great Recession and the co recession it was pretty normal to

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,910
have 70 to 80% of the economies in the world having inflation levels at or

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,150
world having inflation levels at or below 2% so that's Norm you if they

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,629
below 2% so that's Norm you if they throw you into a country I dropped you

00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,990
throw you into a country I dropped you into a country the normal thing would be

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,550
into a country the normal thing would be well it's about 2% that's level of

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,269
well it's about 2% that's level of inflation obviously if I dropped in

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,550
inflation obviously if I dropped in Argentina you're going to find a much

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,590
Argentina you're going to find a much bigger number know 10,000% but but but

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,670
bigger number know 10,000% but but but but the bulk of the countries we around

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,189
but the bulk of the countries we around 2% or so today you don't find any

00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:43,269
2% or so today you don't find any country with inflation below

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:46,629
country with inflation below 2% okay not even Japan that for years

00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:48,870
2% okay not even Japan that for years were in deflation and trying to get sort

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,590
were in deflation and trying to get sort of above zero that's what they all they

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,750
wanted not even in Japan you have inflation below 2% today so this thing I

00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,829
inflation below 2% today so this thing I show you and for more or less the same

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,470
show you and for more or less the same reason

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,389
is happening everywhere not exactly the same factors it's the same episode in

00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,990
same factors it's the same episode in for example in and then with differences

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,790
depending on the structure of the economy or in additional shocks in

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,949
economy or in additional shocks in Europe for example they have very high

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:22,350
inflation H but the problem is not the origin of the problem the bulk of the of

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,110
origin of the problem the bulk of the of the problem is the same as in the US but

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,430
the problem is the same as in the US but the but at the margin they're different

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,470
the but at the margin they're different in in Europe the Big Driver of inflation

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,590
the big recent driver of inflation is unlike the US which is aggregate demand

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,030
unlike the US which is aggregate demand cons j s later is essentially the war in

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,910
cons j s later is essentially the war in Ukraine that has increased the price of

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,990
Ukraine that has increased the price of energy and the price of energy has led

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,389
different reasons but all of them are sort of different reasons that you add

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:49,990
sort of different reasons that you add on top of what is a common story which

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,230
on top of what is a common story which is that we overheated it coming out of

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,710
is that we overheated it coming out of the covid INF

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,110
the covid INF covid episode and and and now we're

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,870
covid episode and and and now we're strugging Str with that now the main

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,389
strugging Str with that now the main tool and we're going to talk a lot about

00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,189
tool and we're going to talk a lot about this in this course the main tool that

00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:06,350
this in this course the main tool that central banks have to deal with

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,389
central banks have to deal with inflation is the interest rate okay so

00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,949
inflation is the interest rate okay so for reasons you'll understand later

00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,629
for reasons you'll understand later although you may have an intuition about

00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:18,949
some of those now obviously when the Central Bank lowers interest rates then

00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,030
Central Bank lowers interest rates then that helps the economy to

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,550
that helps the economy to expand and when it increases interest

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,470
expand and when it increases interest rate then it does the opposite rise in

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,069
rate then it does the opposite rise in interest rate makes mortgages more

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,550
interest rate makes mortgages more expensive make everything more expensive

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,110
expensive make everything more expensive so people to consume less firms tend to

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,150
so people to consume less firms tend to invest less and so on because it's more

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,870
invest less and so on because it's more expensive to invest to borrow to to do

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,030
expensive to invest to borrow to to do something okay and uh and there there

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,350
something okay and uh and there there you see it I mean this was the level of

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,990
you see it I mean this was the level of the interest rate in the US before covid

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,069
the interest rate in the US before covid when covid came boom they brought it all

00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,870
when covid came boom they brought it all the way down it happens that you cannot

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,350
bring interest rate a lot lower than zero as a reason it stay close to zero

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,509
zero as a reason it stay close to zero there we're going to talk about that

00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,749
there we're going to talk about that later on but then eventually they

00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:58,350
later on but then eventually they realized that we're behind the curve

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:06,470
curve so they began to hike rates in a hurry okay and that's what we have been

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,110
hurry okay and that's what we have been experiencing for for the last ER year or

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,350
so okay very fast increase in the interest rate now this is of course

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,110
interest rate now this is of course about macroeconomics but I happen to do

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,629
about macroeconomics but I happen to do a lot of research between macro and

00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,990
a lot of research between macro and finance so I'm going to put a little bit

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,670
finance so I'm going to put a little bit more of a component of Finance into in

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,269
more of a component of Finance into in the in the LA I think I'm going to do

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:30,910
most of that in the last third of the course but monetary policy has lots of

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,629
course but monetary policy has lots of implications for for for for finance for

00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,030
implications for for for for finance for Equity values for the stock market and

00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:51,430
XX 500 is the index the main index of equity in the US of shares

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,150
main index of equity in the US of shares okay there are several indexes NASDAQ

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,870
okay there are several indexes NASDAQ S&P da and so on this is the main index

00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,350
S&P da and so on this is the main index the most comprehensive the one that

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,949
the most comprehensive the one that takes the largest the largest companies

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:04,509
takes the largest the largest companies and so on so forth and when you can see

00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,790
and so on so forth and when you can see what happens here is that when covid

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,509
happened the surprise that we we had really a pandemia then the stock market

00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,230
really a pandemia then the stock market crash decline like 30% or something like

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,309
crash decline like 30% or something like that at the time that's interesting of

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,509
that at the time that's interesting of assets I mean that's one one

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,509
assets I mean that's one one characteristic of of equity that I like

00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,150
characteristic of of equity that I like a lot other risky assets as well but but

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,710
a lot other risky assets as well but but but but they like a lot they anticipate

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,470
what happens what happened there is the stock market the shareholders realized

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,629
stock market the shareholders realized that something big was negative and big

00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,790
was happening in front of us so it was sign to sell you know and so the equity

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:45,749
even more interesting for a microeconomist which is this this big

00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:50,829
boom here it's an enormous Boom the economy here still was at levels of

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:53,309
economy here still was at levels of activity below what it had before covid

00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:57,430
but the stock market the value in the stock market had way exceeded the level

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:03,870
we had before the pandemic okay and the main driver of that I've shown that in

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,309
some papers the main driver of that is not I mean people tell lots of stories

00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,150
not I mean people tell lots of stories you know you know Amazon and so on but

00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,630
Tesla blah blah if you look at the aggregate the main reason for that rise

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,949
aggregate the main reason for that rise was monetary policy was you can explain

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,829
was monetary policy was you can explain all that increase in the equity value in

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,150
all that increase in the equity value in the US of the index not individual

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,829
the US of the index not individual shares of the index by the of interest

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,710
rates okay so monetary policy plays a big role if you care about Finance well

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,750
big role if you care about Finance well it plays a huge role in the value of

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,270
it plays a huge role in the value of assets when monetary policy very loose

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,310
assets when monetary policy very loose that tends to increase the the value of

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,549
that tends to increase the the value of assets and that's one of the mechanism

00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,789
assets and that's one of the mechanism the central banks use to expand

00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:42,909
the central banks use to expand aggregate demand when they want to

00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,190
aggregate demand when they want to expand aggregate demand they want people

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,630
expand aggregate demand they want people to feel if you have in a recession you

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,710
to feel if you have in a recession you want people to feel richer so they spend

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,510
want people to feel richer so they spend more and so on so

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,750
more and so on so forth what happened here this decline

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,669
you can also explain it fully with the hiking interest rate remember I show you

00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,070
hiking interest rate remember I show you that the interest rate began to rise

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,590
very rapidly here well last year the equity Market in the US and most major

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,590
equity Market in the US and most major Equity markets around the world declined

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,630
Equity markets around the world declined by 20% or more you can explain all that

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,710
decline simply by the increase in the interest rate so that's another thing we

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,510
need to understand is why is that the interest why is the interest rate

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,110
interest why is the interest rate matters so much for something like

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,310
matters so much for something like Equity so we're want to Value assets and

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,549
we want to see what is the effect of the interest rate and then we're want to

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,230
interest rate and then we're want to think about well why would the Central

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,390
think about well why would the Central Bank worry or not worry about these

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,430
Bank worry or not worry about these things and so on so forth but the truth

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:34,590
is that financial markets and the central banks interact all the time I

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,750
central banks interact all the time I mean if you are in again into Wall

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,669
mean if you are in again into Wall Street type thing you're going to be

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,950
monetary minutes the minutes of the central banks are released you're going

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,230
central banks are released you're going to be watching because it has a big

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,430
to be watching because it has a big implication for the value of your

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,190
implication for the value of your Equity actually something very

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,750
Equity actually something very interesting of this nature happened last

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,350
interesting of this nature happened last week on

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:06,390
release of payroll numbers so it's an employment index okay employment numbers

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:15,110
and er people expected ER and the the payroll to increase to so to add nonfarm

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,669
payroll to increase to so to add nonfarm payroll we'll talk about this things

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,510
payroll we'll talk about this things later by about

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,310
later by about 190,000

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,950
190,000 workers at 8:30 well and this you're

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,190
workers at 8:30 well and this you're seeing here is the behavior of the same

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,430
index I showed you before but the Futures so the same things you can trade

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,909
before the market actually opens the market in the US opens at 9:30 a.m. but

00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:37,350
market in the US opens at 9:30 a.m. but you can trade Futures since Asia times

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,710
you can trade Futures since Asia times okay anyway so this is the path it's all

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,710
okay anyway so this is the path it's all very quiet tranquil everyone is waiting

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,830
very quiet tranquil everyone is waiting the release of this news at 8:30 a.m. at

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,310
the release of this news at 8:30 a.m. at 8:30 a.m. great news for the labor

00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,070
8:30 a.m. great news for the labor market not only not the the the actual

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,270
market not only not the the the actual change in the payroll was not 190k it

00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,750
change in the payroll was not 190k it was over 500,000 k so enormous addition

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,110
was over 500,000 k so enormous addition of jobs to the economy and look what

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,549
of jobs to the economy and look what happens to the equity Market boom it

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:09,669
imploded immediately so this is wonderful news now for the economy lots

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:17,350
of jobs the equity Market imploded as a result of that why do you think that

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,430
result of that why do you think that happened I already given you a little

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,549
bit of the ingredients for why for an answer in in in in the previous

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:30,909
slides the reason I'm showing you this is because it's a in in in one in 15

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:35,909
minutes it summarizes all that I was talking about in the previous 30

00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:38,750
talking about in the previous 30 minutes why do you think that happened

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,590
minutes why do you think that happened this is wonderful news why why the so

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,310
this is wonderful news why why the so Market Should Crash like 2% from top to

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,950
Market Should Crash like 2% from top to bottom as a result of

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:47,960
1041 00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,870  that there a lot more labor because um

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,630
that there a lot more labor because um that gives a lot more um supply

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,190
that gives a lot more um supply of um that thing and thus it Dees price

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,549
of um that thing and thus it Dees price because High

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:09,990
interesting okay that that's an interesting explanation is not the one I

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,269
interesting explanation is not the one I have in mind it's a the explanation says

00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:15,830
have in mind it's a the explanation says look that means firms hire lots of

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,549
look that means firms hire lots of people so the price the that means there

00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,029
people so the price the that means there going to be lots of supply of whatever

00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,789
going to be lots of supply of whatever Goods they're producing the price of

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:22,990
Goods they're producing the price of those goods is going to decline and

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,190
those goods is going to decline and that's going to be bad for profits

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,070
that's going to be bad for profits that's the story you had in mind

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,230
that's the story you had in mind yeah maybe some of that but I I'm

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,669
yeah maybe some of that but I I'm willing to bet that it's not the main

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,590
thing so the only clue I give you is that I already talk about these things

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,669
that I already talk about these things five minutes

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
1081 00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,789  ago employment is um very closely um

00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:50,510
ago employment is um very closely um related to inflation rates yes up to

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,470
related to inflation rates yes up to 0.81 so this could be result of

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,350
0.81 so this could be result of expectations of high Contin High

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,110
expectations of high Contin High inflation okay you're are very close one

00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,110
inflation okay you're are very close one step more yes

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,029
step more yes that that means that that means that

00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:06,630
that that means that that means that so okay that there you are so what

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,310
happens the bank the the the shareholders wouldn't have done anything

00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,230
shareholders wouldn't have done anything if they thought that the FED would not

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,590
if they thought that the FED would not be able to see this data but they know

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,549
be able to see this data but they know that the FED also sees this data and say

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,269
that the FED also sees this data and say whoa these guys are going to be worried

00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,510
whoa these guys are going to be worried because the econom is going to keep

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,549
because the econom is going to keep overheating they're going to have to

00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,630
overheating they're going to have to hike interest rates even more in order

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,870
hike interest rates even more in order to cool down this economy okay I already

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,470
to cool down this economy okay I already show you that what happens in the labor

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,870
show you that what happens in the labor lab Market is very connected to what

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,149
happens in with inflation the the Central Bank knows that and now you get

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:36,029
Central Bank knows that and now you get this big surprise that means they're not

00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,269
this big surprise that means they're not really being able to they're not been

00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,070
really being able to they're not been successful at really slowing down one of

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,590
successful at really slowing down one of the main drivers of inflation and so

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,909
the main drivers of inflation and so financial markets are very forward

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,350
looking they whoa this is coming this is only means that not going the financial

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,029
only means that not going the financial markets were betting that that the Fed

00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,950
markets were betting that that the Fed was going to begin to cut interest rate

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,990
was going to begin to cut interest rate in four month more or so and if you look

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,190
at qu the forward did that there so the what the market you can you can extract

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:09,149
it all got immediately pushed out to the end of of the Year okay so so it's

00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:12,830
precise it's the anticipation that the central bank will have to do something

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,230
central bank will have to do something and and so I thought it was very

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,230
and and so I thought it was very interesting for that point of

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,950
view recessions well look and these are all very good

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,070
all very good news but everyone knows that the FED

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,590
news but everyone knows that the FED needs to cool off the economy so despite

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,390
needs to cool off the economy so despite the fact that we're getting good news

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,789
the fact that we're getting good news now ER people expect the majority of

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,269
now ER people expect the majority of people expect a recession in the US for

00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:42,830
bar graphic here but these are forecasters these are professional

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,149
forecasters these are professional forecaster and and and more than half of

00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:49,029
forecaster and and and more than half of them so the median of them thinks that

00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:56,549
a recession in the US this year I'm a little well we're going to

00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:58,510
year I'm a little well we're going to talk a lot about this and and probably

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,230
while we're taking the course so this is going to be a sort of picture that we're

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,870
going to be a sort of picture that we're going to discuss

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,870
going to discuss extensively and the reason for that

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,029
recession is nothing else than the reason you ask this forecast why do you

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:14,750
reason you ask this forecast why do you think we may have a recession well

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,390
think we may have a recession well because the FED is trying to fight

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,710
because the FED is trying to fight inflation it's going to keep hiking

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,669
inflation it's going to keep hiking interest rate and at some point it may

00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,510
interest rate and at some point it may break something okay and and and that's

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,870
break something okay and and and that's that's the reason but we're going to all

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,510
that's the reason but we're going to all these things you are going to be able to

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,230
these things you are going to be able to understand very very clearly hope

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,110
understand very very clearly hope through

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,830
through Ms the last thing I want to say before

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,830
Ms the last thing I want to say before uh telling you a little bit the rules of

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,190
the game is that I said before that the story I told you about the US is more or

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,029
story I told you about the US is more or less what it's happened all around you

00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,110
less what it's happened all around you know I was in

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,190
know I was in Chile a month ago I'm Chilean and and

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,750
Chile a month ago I'm Chilean and and they have the same story they start

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,470
they have the same story they start hiking interestate a little earlier

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,269
because they had more inflation than the us but they're going through the same

00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,990
us but they're going through the same cycle

00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,950
cycle um there's one big economy the second

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:11,070
China China was very aggressive in the covid uh policy no so zero covid policy

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,950
covid uh policy no so zero covid policy so they really slowed down their economy

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,230
so they really slowed down their economy that's a consequence they didn't want to

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,029
that's a consequence they didn't want to do that but as a result of a very strict

00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,269
do that but as a result of a very strict Co policy they essentially shut down big

00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,470
Co policy they essentially shut down big parts of the economy for a long time

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,310
that by the way had big impact in the rest of the world through the network of

00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,789
rest of the world through the network of production the chains of production and

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:29,830
production the chains of production and stuff like that that was inflationary in

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,310
stuff like that that was inflationary in itself that part is dissipating but but

00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:37,909
for the their own economy for the domestic economy that really slowed down

00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:40,430
domestic economy that really slowed down China an economy that you know grew

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,190
typically at five and a half to six% a lot higher 15 years ago we're going to

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,909
lot higher 15 years ago we're going to try to understand why later on but last

00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,389
try to understand why later on but last year I don't know it was 3% or or less

00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:52,870
year I don't know it was 3% or or less numbers in

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,950
numbers in China difficult

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,990
China difficult to to figure out they're not equally

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,909
to to figure out they're not equally trans paring to other numbers but but in

00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:05,430
any event but it's very clear that China slowed down a lot and that policy

00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,149
slowed down a lot and that policy recently changed okay the zero Co policy

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:11,710
recently changed okay the zero Co policy change and so there's great expectation

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,950
change and so there's great expectation that now there's going going to be a big

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,269
that now there's going going to be a big boom in China because they're lagging

00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,110
boom in China because they're lagging behind I mean in in in the US when Co

00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,389
behind I mean in in in the US when Co began to dissipate we got a huge boost

00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:21,830
began to dissipate we got a huge boost to growth and that's part of the reason

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,430
to growth and that's part of the reason we got all this inflation is because we

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,590
had lots of growth coming out of the recession that happening in Co and more

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,830
or less the same is expected in China and one of the big reasons behind those

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,430
big bounce backs is where people are desperate they want to spend on

00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,870
desperate they want to spend on something they want to go to restaurants

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,470
and Cinemas and stuff like that and the other one is they have the means to do

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,070
other one is they have the means to do it because they couldn't spend on

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,149
it because they couldn't spend on anything for a while know and so they

00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,870
can travel and stuff like that so so people

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,630
travel and stuff like that so so people expect and this is a m very large

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,190
expect and this is a m very large economy that suddenly sort of wakes up

00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,190
you know that's a big thing for China but it's also big thing for the world

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,070
you know what what happens in China doesn't stay in China it's a big giant

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,310
so it moves and for some countries is very very important in this picture here

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,310
very very important in this picture here it shows you what is the impact on

00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:26,669
most obviously all the neighbors are benefit a lot but Latin America benefits

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,870
benefit a lot but Latin America benefits even more why is that well because Latin

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,149
even more why is that well because Latin America produces lots of Commodities and

00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:33,990
America produces lots of Commodities and China consume lots of commodity when

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,269
China consume lots of commodity when it's building and and stuff like that

00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,110
it's building and and stuff like that and so that's Reon big impact on Latin

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,830
and so that's Reon big impact on Latin America so this is a piece of good news

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,190
America so this is a piece of good news for the world in the sense that activity

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,509
for the world in the sense that activity will go up

00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:49,630
will go up but it's good news on average but it may

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,549
but it's good news on average but it may be too much of a good thing as well why

00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,669
be too much of a good thing as well why because many economies are going through

00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:55,950
because many economies are going through what we described before they're trying

00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,389
what we described before they're trying to bring down inflation they don't want

00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:59,509
to bring down inflation they don't want more demand they want want less for now

00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:01,230
more demand they want want less for now because we're going to understand that

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,149
because we're going to understand that connection later on how demand connects

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,990
connection later on how demand connects to inflation but but you want less and

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,230
now you're going to get this this impulse from China which is going to

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,350
fuel more inflation it's okay for China because they don't have an inflation

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,430
because they don't have an inflation problem but it may be a problem for many

00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,310
problem but it may be a problem for many of the countries that are trying to ER

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:24,230
inflationary consequences of the previous expansion the expansion that

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,310
follow covid okay anyways but this is the kind of things we're going to be

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,310
talking about the I said the course is not going to be mathy but it's going to

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,070
be all about moles the next lecture is the most boring lecture of the course I

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,470
the most boring lecture of the course I I I tell you in advance because it's

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,870
I I tell you in advance because it's definitions I I need to go through

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,870
definitions I I need to go through definition at least I get bored but but

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,590
definition at least I get bored but but the rest there's always with a little

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:51,789
models are going to try to explain the kind of things I I I discuss today so

00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:57,389
that's what this course is about is is is is ideally if we're successful you're

00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:58,870
is is ideally if we're successful you're going to be able to read something like

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,190
the world economic Outlook which will have lots of pictures like this and

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,350
you're going to be able to write a little equation very simple on the side

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,830
little equation very simple on the side to try to understand what is going on

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,389
to try to understand what is going on there and to catch the mistakes as well

00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:16,470
World stre Journal but but you will catch mistakes you'll see you'll be

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,919
catch mistakes you'll see you'll be proud of them

00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,030
everybody's talking about artificial intelligence these days AI machine

00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,829
intelligence these days AI machine learning is another Hot Topic are they

00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:10,310
learning is another Hot Topic are they the same thing or are they different and

00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,990
the same thing or are they different and if so what are those differences and

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,950
if so what are those differences and deep learning is another one that comes

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,790
deep learning is another one that comes into play I actually did a video on

00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,550
into play I actually did a video on these three artificial intelligence

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,509
these three artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning and

00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:23,790
machine learning and deep learning and talked about where they fit and there

00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,429
talked about where they fit and there were a lot of comments on that and I

00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,870
were a lot of comments on that and I read those comments and I'd like to

00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,470
read those comments and I'd like to address some of the most frequently

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,589
address some of the most frequently asked questions so that we clear up some

00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,470
asked questions so that we clear up some of the myths and misconceptions around

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,069
this in addition something else has happened since that video was recorded

00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:40,350
happened since that video was recorded and that is this the absolute explosion

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,910
and that is this the absolute explosion of this area of generative AI things

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,430
of this area of generative AI things like large language models and chat Bots

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,510
like large language models and chat Bots have seemed to be taking over the world

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,750
have seemed to be taking over the world we see them everywhere really

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,630
we see them everywhere really interesting technology uh and then also

00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,150
interesting technology uh and then also things like deep fakes these are all

00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,029
things like deep fakes these are all within the realm of AI but how do they

00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:02,349
within the realm of AI but how do they fit within each other how are they

00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,109
fit within each other how are they related to each other we're going to

00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,030
related to each other we're going to take a look at that in this video and

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,590
take a look at that in this video and try to explain how all these

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,550
try to explain how all these Technologies relate and how we can use

00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,310
them first off a little bit of a disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,469
disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify some of these Concepts in order to not

00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,670
some of these Concepts in order to not make this video last for a week so those

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,350
make this video last for a week so those of you that are really deep experts in

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,230
of you that are really deep experts in the field apologies in advance but we're

00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,149
the field apologies in advance but we're going to try to make this simple and and

00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,149
going to try to make this simple and and that will involve some generalizations

00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,469
that will involve some generalizations first of all let's start with AI

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,270
first of all let's start with AI artificial intelligence is basically

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,230
artificial intelligence is basically trying to simulate with a computer

00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,469
trying to simulate with a computer something that would match or exceed

00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:42,230
something that would match or exceed human intelligence what is intelligence

00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,469
human intelligence what is intelligence well it could be a lot of different

00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,149
well it could be a lot of different things but generally we tend to think of

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,230
things but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn to infer and

00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,550
it as the ability to learn to infer and to reason things like that so that's

00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,270
to reason things like that so that's what we're trying to do in the broad

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,029
what we're trying to do in the broad field of AI of artificial intelligence

00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,590
field of AI of artificial intelligence and if we look at a timeline of AI it

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,149
and if we look at a timeline of AI it really kind of started back around on

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,550
this time frame and in those days it was very premature most people had not even

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,229
heard of it uh and uh it basically was a research project but I can tell you uh

00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,630
research project but I can tell you uh as an undergrad which for me was back

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,509
as an undergrad which for me was back during these times uh we were doing AI

00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,070
during these times uh we were doing AI work in fact we would use programming

00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,229
work in fact we would use programming languages like lisp uh or prologue uh

00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,550
languages like lisp uh or prologue uh and these kinds of things uh were kind

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,509
and these kinds of things uh were kind of the predecessors to what became later

00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:31,910
of the predecessors to what became later expert systems and this was a technology

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,509
expert systems and this was a technology again some of these things existed

00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,630
again some of these things existed previous but that's when it really uh

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,630
previous but that's when it really uh hit kind of a critical mass and became

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,509
hit kind of a critical mass and became more popularized so expert systems of

00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,430
more popularized so expert systems of the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,790
the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again we use Technologies like this all of

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,270
we use Technologies like this all of this uh was was something that we did

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,430
this uh was was something that we did before we ever touched in to the next

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,470
before we ever touched in to the next topic I'm going to talk about and that's

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,630
topic I'm going to talk about and that's the area of machine learning machine

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,149
learning is as its name implies the machine is learning I don't have to

00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:03,229
machine is learning I don't have to program it I give it lots of information

00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,550
program it I give it lots of information and and it observes things so for

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,070
and and it observes things so for instance if I start doing this if I give

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,390
instance if I start doing this if I give you this and then ask you to predict

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,789
you this and then ask you to predict what's the next thing that's going to be

00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,550
what's the next thing that's going to be there well you might get it you might

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,990
not you have very limited training data to base this on but if I gave you one of

00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,070
to base this on but if I gave you one of those and then ask you what to predict

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,830
those and then ask you what to predict would happen next well you're probably

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,470
would happen next well you're probably going to say this and then you're going

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,030
going to say this and then you're going to say it's this and then you think you

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,949
to say it's this and then you think you got it all figured out and then you see

00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,110
got it all figured out and then you see one of these and then all of a sudden I

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,110
give you one of those and throw you a curveball so this in fact and then maybe

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,789
curveball so this in fact and then maybe it it goes on like this so a machine

00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,470
it it goes on like this so a machine learning algorithm is really good at

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,429
learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering

00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,789
looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data the more training

00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,429
patterns within data the more training data you can give it the more confident

00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:48,149
data you can give it the more confident it can be in predicting so predictions

00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,390
it can be in predicting so predictions are one of the things that machine

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,630
are one of the things that machine learning is is particularly good at

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,309
learning is is particularly good at another thing is spotting outliers like

00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:57,229
another thing is spotting outliers like this and saying oh that doesn't belong

00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,149
this and saying oh that doesn't belong in it looks different than all the other

00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:01,830
in it looks different than all the other stuff because the sequence was broken so

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,069
stuff because the sequence was broken so that's particularly useful in cyber

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,350
that's particularly useful in cyber security the area that I work in because

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,030
security the area that I work in because we're looking for outliers we're looking

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,949
we're looking for outliers we're looking for users who are using the system in

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,789
for users who are using the system in ways that they shouldn't be or ways that

00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:17,949
technology machine learning is particularly useful for us and machine

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,670
particularly useful for us and machine learning really came along uh and became

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,310
learning really came along uh and became more popularized uh in this time frame

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,670
more popularized uh in this time frame uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,710
uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back when I was an undergrad riding my

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,110
dinosaur to class we were doing this kind of stuff we never once talked about

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,909
kind of stuff we never once talked about machine learning it might have existed

00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:52,150
basis of a lot we do going forward the next layer of our Vin diagram involves

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,950
next layer of our Vin diagram involves deep learning well it's deep learning in

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,150
deep learning well it's deep learning in the sense that with deep learning we use

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,310
the sense that with deep learning we use these things called neural networks

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,950
neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,310
the human brain works at least to the extent that we understand how the brain

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,189
extent that we understand how the brain works and it's called Deep because we

00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,270
works and it's called Deep because we have multiple layers of those neural

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,590
have multiple layers of those neural networks and the interesting thing about

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:20,070
these is they will simulate the way a brain operates but I don't know if

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,230
you've noticed but human brains can be a little bit unpredictable you put certain

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,029
little bit unpredictable you put certain things in you don't always get the very

00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,710
same thing out and deep learning is the same way in some cases we're not

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,749
same way in some cases we're not actually able to fully understand why we

00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,230
actually able to fully understand why we get the results we do uh because there

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,270
get the results we do uh because there are so many layers to the neural network

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,550
are so many layers to the neural network it's a little bit hard to to decompose

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,590
it's a little bit hard to to decompose and figure out exactly what's in there

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,550
and figure out exactly what's in there but this has become a very important

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,909
but this has become a very important part and a very important advancement

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,110
part and a very important advancement that also reached some popularity during

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,270
that also reached some popularity during the 2010s and as something that we use

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,070
the 2010s and as something that we use still today as the basis for our next

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,150
still today as the basis for our next area of AI the most recent advancements

00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,670
area of AI the most recent advancements in the field of artificial in

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,189
intelligence all really are in this space the area of generative AI now I'm

00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,550
space the area of generative AI now I'm going to introduce a term that you may

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,469
going to introduce a term that you may not be familiar with it's the idea of

00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:13,710
foundation models Foundation models is where we get some of these kinds of

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,790
things for instance an example of a foundation model would be a large

00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,749
foundation model would be a large language model which is where we take

00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,189
language model which is where we take language and we model it and we make

00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,990
language and we model it and we make predictions in this technology where if

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,629
predictions in this technology where if I see certain types of of words then I

00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,390
I see certain types of of words then I can sort of predict what the next set of

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,909
can sort of predict what the next set of words will be I'm going to oversimplify

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,870
words will be I'm going to oversimplify here for the sake of Simplicity but

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,790
here for the sake of Simplicity but think about this as a little bit like

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,189
think about this as a little bit like the autoc complete when you start typing

00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,309
the autoc complete when you start typing something in and then it predicts what

00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:45,150
your next word will be except in this case with large language models they're

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,070
case with large language models they're not predicting the next word they're

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,430
not predicting the next word they're predicting the next sentence the next

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,230
predicting the next sentence the next paragraph the next entire document so

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,589
paragraph the next entire document so there's a really an amazing exponential

00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,029
there's a really an amazing exponential leap in what these things are able to do

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,710
leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,550
and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,070
generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,749
new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,670
made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,749
isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just

00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:14,110
Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,270
regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,909
putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:25,189
music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,029
already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some

00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,309
every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that

00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,350
other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,950
already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,749
them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people

00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,510
say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,029
are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,589
songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's

00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,149
going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some

00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,710
imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,990
lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,110
take with other types of models are uh Audio models

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,990
Audio models uh video models and things like that

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,550
uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,670
well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,550
where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,510
person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,430
then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,309
things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,510
useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,149
parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,710
someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,070
could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,230
they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,949
to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff

00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:36,589
also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,190
could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,509
come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of

00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,870
from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,790
Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,509
really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content

00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,790
possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,269
or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,150
content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,030
has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,350
where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,069
things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most

00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,590
adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,910
people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,590
if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,269
seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,990
away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,790
learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,269
and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,870
Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,910
came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,590
these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:42,550
thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,430
is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,389

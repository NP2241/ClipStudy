1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,270
the earth's core is mostly made of heavy

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,440
metals like iron and nickel whereas the

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,640
crust the outer thin crust is made of

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,639
the lighter silicates why is it like

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,360
that why are the heavy stuff close to

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,880
the center whereas the lighter ones are

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,440
closer to the surface and if you

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,719
consider extremely cold places like say

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,680
Antarctica the average temperature over

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,160
there is close to- 50° C which is very

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,160
below the freezing point of water and

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,599
yet for some reason the oceans and the

13
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,039
lakes do not freeze over there and

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,560
that's why aquatic light survives but

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,200
why don't they freeze well to answer

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,800
this question we need to dig deeper into

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,079
the idea of fluids and densities and

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,399
that's what we want to do in this video

19
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,640
so let's begin so what exactly are

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,920
fluids fluids are substances that flow

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,760
and they do that because they don't have

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,840
a fixed shape so think about liquids and

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
gases collectively we call them fluids

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,160
and if you consider our planet the most

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,559
of the surface of the planet is covered

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,359
with liquid water that is a fluid

27
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,640
because water can flow rivers and all

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,399
flow and what about our atmosphere well

29
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,840
it's air which is a gas which is also a

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,960
fluid because again we know that it

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,680
flows giving us air currents and breezes

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,200
and storms and whatnot in contrast if

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,840
you consider the Solid Surfaces over

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,920
here they do not flow because they have

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,079
a fixed shape now of course over very

36
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,280
large time scales they too can flow

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
because of geological processes but

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,320
we're going to ignore that okay solids

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
do not flow because they have a fixed

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,439
shape but

41
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,960
why why do solids have a fixed shape to

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,040
answer that question we need to zoom in

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,520
at the atomic or the molecular level if

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
you could zoom into a solid like for

45
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,240
example ice the molecules experience a

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
force of attraction that makes them

47
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,079
stick to each other but they also have a

48
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,479
thermal motion which makes them move

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,799
away from each other now in solids the

50
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,200
thermal motion is low enough that the

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,240
attraction vins and as a result

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,079
molecules and atoms end up sticking to

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
each other giving them a particular

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,119
shape however when you consider the

55
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,520
liquid phase of that same substance

56
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,360
the temperatures are relatively higher

57
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,159
so thermal motions are relatively higher

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,039
high enough to partially overcome the

59
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,719
attraction because of which they no

60
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,280
longer are able to retain the shape

61
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,599
that's why liquids tend to take the

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,720
shape of the container and what about

63
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,560
the gas phase well here the thermal

64
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,440
motion is so high that it completely

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
overcomes the attractive forces because

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,599
of which the particles are pretty much

67
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,160
moving freely so look in liquids and

68
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,239
gases the thermal motion of the

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,120
molecules can overcome the attractive

70
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,920
forces that makes them flow all right so

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
the fluids flow what's the big deal well

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,040
the big deal is because they flow when

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,160
you mix two different fluids or a fluid

74
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,480
and a solid they can sink or float and

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
that has a huge consequence as we will

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,480
see but what decides whether something

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,760
sinks or floats well that depends on an

78
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,840
important property called density you

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,000
can think of density as a ratio of mass

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,760
and volume so the standard unit for

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
density would be well mass is in

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
kilograms and volume would be meter cube

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
so density's standard units would be

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,840
kilog per M Cube but what exactly does

85
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,159
it represent well think about density as

86
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,640
a measure of how crowded something is or

87
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,560
how packed something is you know how

88
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,040
much mass is packed in a unit volume how

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
many kilograms are packed in a m Cube or

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,720
you know a more convenient unit would be

91
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,440
how many grams are packed in a centime

92
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,080
cube whatever it is it's a measure of

93
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,680
how packed something is so let's take

94
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,519
some examples if you take water for

95
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,120
example it has a den of 1,000 kg per M

96
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,519
Cube so you can imagine a m cube of

97
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,640
water contains 1,000 kg of water but

98
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,519
again I like to think in terms of gram

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,040
per CM Cube that's more convenient so if

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,400
you convert this you end up with 1 G per

101
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,280
CM Cube the idea is the same if you now

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,120
take a CM cube of water it will have a

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,200
mass of 1 g in contrast if you consider

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,040
ion it has a density of 7.8 G per CM

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,159
cube a cenm cube of ion has 7.8 G of ion

106
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,879
packed into it which is much higher

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,720
density compared to water and by the way

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,959
if you're wondering whether this is a

109
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,079
coincidence that the you know density of

110
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,760
water is exactly 1 G per CM Cube such a

111
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,079
nice number it's not a coincidence we

112
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,519
defined our gram this way the mass of 1

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,400
cm cube of Water by definition is 1 G

114
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,160
but anyways if you consider water or ion

115
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,040
for that matter the densities are

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
uniform it's the same everywhere which

117
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,040
means if you take a small amount of

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
water here or a large chunk of water

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,720
over here the density will be the same 1

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,840
G per CM Cube similarly if you take a a

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
small chunk of iron from here or a big

122
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,759
chunk of iron from a ship for example

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,120
the density would be the same 7.8 G per

124
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,840
CM Cube but that's not always the case

125
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
if you consider the density of the air

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
for example close to the surface of the

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,400
Earth it is roughly about

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,479
0.1 G per cmq you can see the density of

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,199
the air is much much smaller than that

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,560
of water it's about thousand times

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
smaller however if you consider the

132
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
density of the air you know at say about

133
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,320
10 km which is usually the cruising

134
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,160
altitude

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
of a commercial airline you would find

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,160
the density even lower

137
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,560
004 approximately G per CM cub and in

138
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,000
fact the higher you go the smaller the

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,240
density but why well think about it this

140
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,919
way if you consider the layer of air

141
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,039
over here it's carrying the weight of

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
the atmosphere on top of it that weight

143
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,639
is pushing down on the molecules over

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,160
here squeezing them together packing

145
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,000
them together giving them a specific

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,960
density but now if you consider a layer

147
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,240
of air that is even lower then look it's

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
carrying an additional weight compared

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,400
to this layer so it's carrying more

150
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,319
weight in fact the layer at the bottom

151
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,960
carries the entire weight of the

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
atmosphere and therefore the forces are

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,800
much higher and so the molecules are

154
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
squeezed together much higher packed

155
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,680
together more tightly giving you a

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
higher density and that's why the lower

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
you go higher the density but wait

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,919
shouldn't the same be the case with

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,319
water as well for example if you

160
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,800
consider the the ocean then shouldn't

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
the layer at the bottom of the ocean

162
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,639
have a higher density than the layer at

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,680
the top of the ocean well that's a great

164
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,080
question but turns out not to be so

165
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,280
because of one main difference between

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,599
liquids and gases gases can be easily

167
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,400
compressed and to demonstrate this here

168
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,360
is a syringe which contains only air and

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I've sealed the top with my finger now

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,479
let me try and push it and you can see I

171
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,160
can easily compress it I have compressed

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,039
the gas and I've increased the density

173
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,960
just by using my finger but now let's

174
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,199
see what happens if you fill the syringe

175
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
with water

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,280
again seal the top with my finger and

177
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,160
now if I'm pushing it no look it's I

178
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,840
can't compress it even a little bit I am

179
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
pushing as hard as I can it's just not

180
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
possible so this means liquids are

181
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,599
extremely hard to compress and because

182
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,479
you can't compress them you can't

183
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
squeeze the molecules closer and you

184
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
can't increase the density and so that's

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,120
why even though at the bottom the

186
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
pressures are insanely High compared to

187
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,879
the top of the oceans in fact the

188
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,199
pressures at the bottom are so high that

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,560
even submarines can get crushed but

190
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,479
because compressing water is extremely

191
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,199
difficult the molecules will not come

192
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,960
any closer than they are at the top and

193
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,560
as a result the density is pretty much

194
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
the same everywhere and so we would

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,039
model water as an ideal fluid which is

196
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,599
in compressible I mean technically you

197
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,680
can compress water if you put horrendous

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
amounts of forces but since we're not

199
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,240
dealing with such high forces usually we

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,000
can model it to be incompressible so

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,840
ideal fluids are incompressible and they

202
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,039
also have no viscosity what does that

203
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,879
mean well some fluids can be very thick

204
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,720
making them very hard to flow think

205
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,319
about ketchup or honey for example

206
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,199
because of their thickness or viscosity

207
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,639
it can produce resistance to motion but

208
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,240
if we dealing with ideal fluids we model

209
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,039
them by saying that hey ideal fluids

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,919
have no viscosity at all all right now

211
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,520
let's try to explore why stuff sinks or

212
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,879
floats when we mix fluids or fluid in a

213
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,400
solid so let's see what happens when you

214
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
mix water and oil what we notice is that

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,400
if you allow them to settle oil Floats

216
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
or you could say that water sinks but

217
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
why well first of all we can easily

218
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,479
model them as ideal fluids because the

219
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,520
density is pretty much the same

220
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,400
everywhere what you would find now is

221
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,599
that oil has a density that's less than

222
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,400
that of water so stuff that has less

223
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
density tends to float or you could say

224
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
that water has a density more than that

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,039
of oil and therefore it sinks stuff that

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,560
has more density tends to sink let's

227
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,039
take another example if you put an iron

228
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,080
bolt in in water it sinks why because we

229
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,800
already saw ion has a much higher

230
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,519
density than water what about ice ice

231
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,360
floats on water because it has a less

232
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,800
density than water here's another way to

233
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,959
think about it here the gravitational

234
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,480
field is acting downwards isn't it so

235
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,000
stuff which has more density tends to

236
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
move in the direction of the

237
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,320
gravitational field sinking and stuff

238
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,760
that has less density tends to move

239
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,120
against the gravitational field what's

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,040
interesting is that without the

241
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
gravitational field we wouldn't have

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
flotation or Sinking and it's for the

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,279
same reason why helium balloons tend to

244
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,360
move up because they have a density

245
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,880
that's less than the surrounding air and

246
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,240
therefore they move up against the

247
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,800
gravitational field okay now let's see

248
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,079
if we can use this to explain our

249
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,959
original question about the Earth when

250
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
the earth was formed we beli that it was

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
highly molten and so we can model them

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,959
as a you know as an ideal fluid now in

253
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,000
this fluid the gravitational field acts

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,519
towards the center so stuff that is

255
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,079
having a high density like iron and

256
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,880
nickel they will tend to move along the

257
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,320
gravitational field sinking and

258
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,480
eventually settling towards the core on

259
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,640
the other hand stuff that has lighter

260
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
you know lower density like the

261
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,760
silicates for example tend to move

262
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,519
against the gravitational field they had

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,160
to float and that's why they settle near

264
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,959
the surface and that's why eventually

265
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,000
when this molten rock cool to form the

266
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Earth the core ended up having high

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
density heavy metals and the crust ends

268
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,920
up having the silicates amazing isn't it

269
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,279
finally we go back to water we know that

270
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
ice floats on water but that's a little

271
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,279
weird if you think about it because

272
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
whenever you cool something the molecule

273
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,800
tends to have less thermal motion

274
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,120
because of which they tend to come

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,279
closer together so the density actually

276
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,000
increases when you cool stuff generally

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,720
okay that kind of makes sense right so

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
in reality density depends on

279
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
temperature and the same thing works for

280
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
water as you cool down water its density

281
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
will will keep increasing until we reach

282
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
4° C guess what turns out that water has

283
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,920
a maximum density at 4° C and that

284
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,720
maximum density is 1 G per cmq so we

285
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,760
should have actually told you know that

286
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,800
the water's density is 1 G per CM Cube

287
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
or 1,000 kg per M Cube whatever you want

288
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,639
to think of it as at 4° C because

289
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,760
density does depend on temperature but

290
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,399
wait what happens if you cool down water

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,680
below 4° C well now molecules will have

292
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
such low thermal energy that they lock

293
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,200
in places and look in doing so they

294
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,360
start forming gaps in between which

295
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,519
reduces the overall density and that's

296
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,360
why density tends to decrease below 4° C

297
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,240
and eventually as water crystallizes

298
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,680
into ice ice ends up having lower

299
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,200
density than water and therefore ends up

300
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
floating and this has a huge consequence

301
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,720
on the Aquatic Life in really really

302
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,160
cool places so if we go back to our

303
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,519
Antarctica for example we can model

304
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,360
Water by considering three different

305
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,000
layers okay let's say the current

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,920
temperature is about 60° C okay now what

307
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,279
if the temperature outside reduces to 5°

308
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,040
Celsius what's going to happen well the

309
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,839
surface of the water which is in direct

310
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
contact with the surrounding that is

311
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
first going to lose heat and as a result

312
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,560
reduce its temperature to 5° C now

313
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
because it is colder it has a higher

314
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,399
density and as a result it will sink

315
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,600
below the other layers and now this one

316
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,120
will you know cool down to 5° C it gets

317
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
colder it gets higher density it will

318
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,959
sink and eventually the last layer will

319
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,880
come on top so this is how we can model

320
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,480
how extremely large water bodies cool

321
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,120
down now if the temperature gets lower

322
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,560
to say 4° C again the same thing repeats

323
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,279
and the whole ocean now is at 4° C but

324
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,720
at 4° C remember we have maximum density

325
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,000
now if the saring temperature goes below

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,160
4° C let's say 3° C again the top layer

327
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,880
will go down to 3° C because it's in

328
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,680
direct contact but look now the density

329
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,480
is lower than the layers below which

330
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,240
means it cannot sink it will keep

331
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
floating and these layers will not have

332
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
a chance to keep come in contact with

333
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,079
the surrounding layer and therefore

334
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,279
relatively they will stay warm pretty

335
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,160
close to 4° C and now as the temperature

336
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,000
keeps dropping this is the layer that's

337
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
whose temperature will keep dropping

338
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
keeping the lower layers warm and

339
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
eventually this layer will crystallize

340
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
and now it doesn't matter how cold it

341
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,120
gets outside the lower layers are

342
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,000
protected and this is why only the top

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,839
of the water body tends to get Frozen

344
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,720
and the bottom will stay relatively warm

345
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,360
and it will stay in the liquid form it

346
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,560
allows Aquatic Life to exist

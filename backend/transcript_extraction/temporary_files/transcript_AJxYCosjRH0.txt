00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,630
metals like iron and nickel whereas the crust the outer thin crust is made of

00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,629
crust the outer thin crust is made of the lighter silicates why is it like

00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:10,350
the lighter silicates why is it like that why are the heavy stuff close to

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,430
the center whereas the lighter ones are closer to the surface and if you

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,709
closer to the surface and if you consider extremely cold places like say

00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,670
consider extremely cold places like say Antarctica the average temperature over

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,150
Antarctica the average temperature over there is close to- 50° C which is very

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,150
there is close to- 50° C which is very below the freezing point of water and

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,029
yet for some reason the oceans and the lakes do not freeze over there and

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,550
lakes do not freeze over there and that's why aquatic light survives but

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,190
that's why aquatic light survives but why don't they freeze well to answer

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,790
why don't they freeze well to answer this question we need to dig deeper into

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,069
this question we need to dig deeper into the idea of fluids and densities and

00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:39,389
the idea of fluids and densities and that's what we want to do in this video

00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:44,910
so let's begin so what exactly are fluids fluids are substances that flow

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,830
and they do that because they don't have a fixed shape so think about liquids and

00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,229
a fixed shape so think about liquids and gases collectively we call them fluids

00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,150
gases collectively we call them fluids and if you consider our planet the most

00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,549
and if you consider our planet the most of the surface of the planet is covered

00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,349
of the surface of the planet is covered with liquid water that is a fluid

00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,630
with liquid water that is a fluid because water can flow rivers and all

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,389
because water can flow rivers and all flow and what about our atmosphere well

00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,950
it's air which is a gas which is also a fluid because again we know that it

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,670
fluid because again we know that it flows giving us air currents and breezes

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,190
flows giving us air currents and breezes and storms and whatnot in contrast if

00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,830
and storms and whatnot in contrast if you consider the Solid Surfaces over

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:21,069
here they do not flow because they have a fixed shape now of course over very

00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,270
a fixed shape now of course over very large time scales they too can flow

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,590
large time scales they too can flow because of geological processes but

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,310
because of geological processes but we're going to ignore that okay solids

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,310
we're going to ignore that okay solids do not flow because they have a fixed

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,429
do not flow because they have a fixed shape but

00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,950
shape but why why do solids have a fixed shape to

00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,030
why why do solids have a fixed shape to answer that question we need to zoom in

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,510
answer that question we need to zoom in at the atomic or the molecular level if

00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,310
at the atomic or the molecular level if you could zoom into a solid like for

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,830
example ice the molecules experience a force of attraction that makes them

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,469
stick to each other but they also have a thermal motion which makes them move

00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:52,230
thermal motion is low enough that the attraction vins and as a result

00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,069
attraction vins and as a result molecules and atoms end up sticking to

00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,149
molecules and atoms end up sticking to each other giving them a particular

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,510
shape however when you consider the liquid phase of that same substance

00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,350
liquid phase of that same substance the temperatures are relatively higher

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,149
the temperatures are relatively higher so thermal motions are relatively higher

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,709
high enough to partially overcome the attraction because of which they no

00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,270
attraction because of which they no longer are able to retain the shape

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,710
that's why liquids tend to take the shape of the container and what about

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,550
shape of the container and what about the gas phase well here the thermal

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,430
the gas phase well here the thermal motion is so high that it completely

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,190
motion is so high that it completely overcomes the attractive forces because

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,589
overcomes the attractive forces because of which the particles are pretty much

00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:23,150
of which the particles are pretty much moving freely so look in liquids and

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,110
gases the thermal motion of the molecules can overcome the attractive

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,910
molecules can overcome the attractive forces that makes them flow all right so

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,949
forces that makes them flow all right so the fluids flow what's the big deal well

00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,030
the fluids flow what's the big deal well the big deal is because they flow when

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,150
the big deal is because they flow when you mix two different fluids or a fluid

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,470
you mix two different fluids or a fluid and a solid they can sink or float and

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,470
that has a huge consequence as we will see but what decides whether something

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,830
sinks or floats well that depends on an important property called density you

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,990
important property called density you can think of density as a ratio of mass

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,750
can think of density as a ratio of mass and volume so the standard unit for

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,430
and volume so the standard unit for density would be well mass is in

00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,990
density would be well mass is in kilograms and volume would be meter cube

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,670
kilograms and volume would be meter cube so density's standard units would be

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,830
so density's standard units would be kilog per M Cube but what exactly does

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,149
kilog per M Cube but what exactly does it represent well think about density as

00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,630
it represent well think about density as a measure of how crowded something is or

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,550
a measure of how crowded something is or how packed something is you know how

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,030
how packed something is you know how much mass is packed in a unit volume how

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,229
much mass is packed in a unit volume how many kilograms are packed in a m Cube or

00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:19,710
many kilograms are packed in a m Cube or you know a more convenient unit would be

00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,430
you know a more convenient unit would be how many grams are packed in a centime

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,070
how many grams are packed in a centime cube whatever it is it's a measure of

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,670
cube whatever it is it's a measure of how packed something is so let's take

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,509
how packed something is so let's take some examples if you take water for

00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,110
some examples if you take water for example it has a den of 1,000 kg per M

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,509
example it has a den of 1,000 kg per M Cube so you can imagine a m cube of

00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:37,630
Cube so you can imagine a m cube of water contains 1,000 kg of water but

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,509
water contains 1,000 kg of water but again I like to think in terms of gram

00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,030
again I like to think in terms of gram per CM Cube that's more convenient so if

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,390
per CM Cube that's more convenient so if you convert this you end up with 1 G per

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,270
you convert this you end up with 1 G per CM Cube the idea is the same if you now

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,190
take a CM cube of water it will have a mass of 1 g in contrast if you consider

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,030
mass of 1 g in contrast if you consider ion it has a density of 7.8 G per CM

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,149
ion it has a density of 7.8 G per CM cube a cenm cube of ion has 7.8 G of ion

00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,869
cube a cenm cube of ion has 7.8 G of ion packed into it which is much higher

00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,710
packed into it which is much higher density compared to water and by the way

00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,069
if you're wondering whether this is a coincidence that the you know density of

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,069
water is exactly 1 G per CM Cube such a nice number it's not a coincidence we

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,509
nice number it's not a coincidence we defined our gram this way the mass of 1

00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:17,390
defined our gram this way the mass of 1 cm cube of Water by definition is 1 G

00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,150
cm cube of Water by definition is 1 G but anyways if you consider water or ion

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,870
for that matter the densities are uniform it's the same everywhere which

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,030
uniform it's the same everywhere which means if you take a small amount of

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,830
means if you take a small amount of water here or a large chunk of water

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,710
water here or a large chunk of water over here the density will be the same 1

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,710
G per CM Cube similarly if you take a a small chunk of iron from here or a big

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,749
small chunk of iron from here or a big chunk of iron from a ship for example

00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,110
chunk of iron from a ship for example the density would be the same 7.8 G per

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,830
the density would be the same 7.8 G per CM Cube but that's not always the case

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,390
CM Cube but that's not always the case if you consider the density of the air

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,390
for example close to the surface of the Earth it is roughly about

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,469
Earth it is roughly about 0.1 G per cmq you can see the density of

00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:51,189
0.1 G per cmq you can see the density of the air is much much smaller than that

00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,550
the air is much much smaller than that of water it's about thousand times

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,150
smaller however if you consider the density of the air you know at say about

00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,310
density of the air you know at say about 10 km which is usually the cruising

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,150
10 km which is usually the cruising altitude

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,310
altitude of a commercial airline you would find

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,150
of a commercial airline you would find the density even lower

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,550
the density even lower 004 approximately G per CM cub and in

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:16,909
density but why well think about it this way if you consider the layer of air

00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,029
way if you consider the layer of air over here it's carrying the weight of

00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,230
over here it's carrying the weight of the atmosphere on top of it that weight

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,629
the atmosphere on top of it that weight is pushing down on the molecules over

00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,150
is pushing down on the molecules over here squeezing them together packing

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,990
here squeezing them together packing them together giving them a specific

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,950
them together giving them a specific density but now if you consider a layer

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,230
density but now if you consider a layer of air that is even lower then look it's

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,710
of air that is even lower then look it's carrying an additional weight compared

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,390
carrying an additional weight compared to this layer so it's carrying more

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,309
to this layer so it's carrying more weight in fact the layer at the bottom

00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:49,790
much higher and so the molecules are squeezed together much higher packed

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,430
together more tightly giving you a higher density and that's why the lower

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,390
higher density and that's why the lower you go higher the density but wait

00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,909
you go higher the density but wait shouldn't the same be the case with

00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,309
shouldn't the same be the case with water as well for example if you

00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,790
water as well for example if you consider the the ocean then shouldn't

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,629
the layer at the bottom of the ocean have a higher density than the layer at

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,670
have a higher density than the layer at the top of the ocean well that's a great

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,070
the top of the ocean well that's a great question but turns out not to be so

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,270
question but turns out not to be so because of one main difference between

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,589
because of one main difference between liquids and gases gases can be easily

00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,390
liquids and gases gases can be easily compressed and to demonstrate this here

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,350
compressed and to demonstrate this here is a syringe which contains only air and

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,350
is a syringe which contains only air and I've sealed the top with my finger now

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,469
I've sealed the top with my finger now let me try and push it and you can see I

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,150
let me try and push it and you can see I can easily compress it I have compressed

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,029
can easily compress it I have compressed the gas and I've increased the density

00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,950
the gas and I've increased the density just by using my finger but now let's

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,189
just by using my finger but now let's see what happens if you fill the syringe

00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,309
see what happens if you fill the syringe with water

00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,270
with water again seal the top with my finger and

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,150
again seal the top with my finger and now if I'm pushing it no look it's I

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,830
now if I'm pushing it no look it's I can't compress it even a little bit I am

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,950
can't compress it even a little bit I am pushing as hard as I can it's just not

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,589
possible so this means liquids are extremely hard to compress and because

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,469
extremely hard to compress and because you can't compress them you can't

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,309
you can't compress them you can't squeeze the molecules closer and you

00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,309
squeeze the molecules closer and you can't increase the density and so that's

00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:56,510
why even though at the bottom the pressures are insanely High compared to

00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,189
the top of the oceans in fact the pressures at the bottom are so high that

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,550
pressures at the bottom are so high that even submarines can get crushed but

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,469
even submarines can get crushed but because compressing water is extremely

00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,189
because compressing water is extremely difficult the molecules will not come

00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,950
difficult the molecules will not come any closer than they are at the top and

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,550
any closer than they are at the top and as a result the density is pretty much

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:18,589
model water as an ideal fluid which is in compressible I mean technically you

00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,670
in compressible I mean technically you can compress water if you put horrendous

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,909
can compress water if you put horrendous amounts of forces but since we're not

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,230
amounts of forces but since we're not dealing with such high forces usually we

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,990
dealing with such high forces usually we can model it to be incompressible so

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,830
can model it to be incompressible so ideal fluids are incompressible and they

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,029
ideal fluids are incompressible and they also have no viscosity what does that

00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,869
also have no viscosity what does that mean well some fluids can be very thick

00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:38,710
mean well some fluids can be very thick making them very hard to flow think

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,309
making them very hard to flow think about ketchup or honey for example

00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,189
about ketchup or honey for example because of their thickness or viscosity

00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,629
because of their thickness or viscosity it can produce resistance to motion but

00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,230
it can produce resistance to motion but if we dealing with ideal fluids we model

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,029
if we dealing with ideal fluids we model them by saying that hey ideal fluids

00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,909
them by saying that hey ideal fluids have no viscosity at all all right now

00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,510
have no viscosity at all all right now let's try to explore why stuff sinks or

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,390
floats when we mix fluids or fluid in a solid so let's see what happens when you

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,710
solid so let's see what happens when you mix water and oil what we notice is that

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,390
mix water and oil what we notice is that if you allow them to settle oil Floats

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,790
if you allow them to settle oil Floats or you could say that water sinks but

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,790
or you could say that water sinks but why well first of all we can easily

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,510
model them as ideal fluids because the density is pretty much the same

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,390
that oil has a density that's less than that of water so stuff that has less

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,950
that of water so stuff that has less density tends to float or you could say

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,790
density tends to float or you could say that water has a density more than that

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,029
that water has a density more than that of oil and therefore it sinks stuff that

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,550
of oil and therefore it sinks stuff that has more density tends to sink let's

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,029
has more density tends to sink let's take another example if you put an iron

00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:31,070
take another example if you put an iron bolt in in water it sinks why because we

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,790
bolt in in water it sinks why because we already saw ion has a much higher

00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,509
already saw ion has a much higher density than water what about ice ice

00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,350
density than water what about ice ice floats on water because it has a less

00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,790
floats on water because it has a less density than water here's another way to

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,949
density than water here's another way to think about it here the gravitational

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:45,470
think about it here the gravitational field is acting downwards isn't it so

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,990
field is acting downwards isn't it so stuff which has more density tends to

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,310
move in the direction of the gravitational field sinking and stuff

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,750
gravitational field sinking and stuff that has less density tends to move

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,110
that has less density tends to move against the gravitational field what's

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:02,269
flotation or Sinking and it's for the same reason why helium balloons tend to

00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,350
same reason why helium balloons tend to move up because they have a density

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,870
move up because they have a density that's less than the surrounding air and

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,790
therefore they move up against the gravitational field okay now let's see

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,069
gravitational field okay now let's see if we can use this to explain our

00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,949
if we can use this to explain our original question about the Earth when

00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:19,350
the earth was formed we beli that it was highly molten and so we can model them

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,949
highly molten and so we can model them as a you know as an ideal fluid now in

00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:25,990
as a you know as an ideal fluid now in this fluid the gravitational field acts

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,069
towards the center so stuff that is having a high density like iron and

00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:36,310
nickel they will tend to move along the gravitational field sinking and

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,470
gravitational field sinking and eventually settling towards the core on

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,630
eventually settling towards the core on the other hand stuff that has lighter

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,750
you know lower density like the silicates for example tend to move

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,150
against the gravitational field they had to float and that's why they settle near

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,949
to float and that's why they settle near the surface and that's why eventually

00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:57,350
when this molten rock cool to form the Earth the core ended up having high

00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,750
Earth the core ended up having high density heavy metals and the crust ends

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,910
density heavy metals and the crust ends up having the silicates amazing isn't it

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,269
up having the silicates amazing isn't it finally we go back to water we know that

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,509
finally we go back to water we know that ice floats on water but that's a little

00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,269
ice floats on water but that's a little weird if you think about it because

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:11,750
weird if you think about it because whenever you cool something the molecule

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,790
whenever you cool something the molecule tends to have less thermal motion

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,110
tends to have less thermal motion because of which they tend to come

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,269
because of which they tend to come closer together so the density actually

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,990
closer together so the density actually increases when you cool stuff generally

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,710
increases when you cool stuff generally okay that kind of makes sense right so

00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,030
okay that kind of makes sense right so in reality density depends on

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,790
in reality density depends on temperature and the same thing works for

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,110
temperature and the same thing works for water as you cool down water its density

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,389
water as you cool down water its density will will keep increasing until we reach

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:38,910
4° C guess what turns out that water has a maximum density at 4° C and that

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,710
a maximum density at 4° C and that maximum density is 1 G per cmq so we

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,750
maximum density is 1 G per cmq so we should have actually told you know that

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,790
should have actually told you know that the water's density is 1 G per CM Cube

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,670
the water's density is 1 G per CM Cube or 1,000 kg per M Cube whatever you want

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,629
or 1,000 kg per M Cube whatever you want to think of it as at 4° C because

00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,750
to think of it as at 4° C because density does depend on temperature but

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,389
density does depend on temperature but wait what happens if you cool down water

00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,750
below 4° C well now molecules will have such low thermal energy that they lock

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,190
such low thermal energy that they lock in places and look in doing so they

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,350
in places and look in doing so they start forming gaps in between which

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,509
start forming gaps in between which reduces the overall density and that's

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,350
reduces the overall density and that's why density tends to decrease below 4° C

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,230
why density tends to decrease below 4° C and eventually as water crystallizes

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,670
and eventually as water crystallizes into ice ice ends up having lower

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,190
into ice ice ends up having lower density than water and therefore ends up

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,590
density than water and therefore ends up floating and this has a huge consequence

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,710
floating and this has a huge consequence on the Aquatic Life in really really

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,150
on the Aquatic Life in really really cool places so if we go back to our

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,509
cool places so if we go back to our Antarctica for example we can model

00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,350
Antarctica for example we can model Water by considering three different

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,990
Water by considering three different layers okay let's say the current

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,910
layers okay let's say the current temperature is about 60° C okay now what

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,269
temperature is about 60° C okay now what if the temperature outside reduces to 5°

00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,829
Celsius what's going to happen well the surface of the water which is in direct

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,069
contact with the surrounding that is first going to lose heat and as a result

00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,550
first going to lose heat and as a result reduce its temperature to 5° C now

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,870
reduce its temperature to 5° C now because it is colder it has a higher

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,389
because it is colder it has a higher density and as a result it will sink

00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,590
density and as a result it will sink below the other layers and now this one

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,110
below the other layers and now this one will you know cool down to 5° C it gets

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,870
sink and eventually the last layer will come on top so this is how we can model

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,470
come on top so this is how we can model how extremely large water bodies cool

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,110
how extremely large water bodies cool down now if the temperature gets lower

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,550
down now if the temperature gets lower to say 4° C again the same thing repeats

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,269
to say 4° C again the same thing repeats and the whole ocean now is at 4° C but

00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,710
and the whole ocean now is at 4° C but at 4° C remember we have maximum density

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,990
at 4° C remember we have maximum density now if the saring temperature goes below

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,150
now if the saring temperature goes below 4° C let's say 3° C again the top layer

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,870
4° C let's say 3° C again the top layer will go down to 3° C because it's in

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,670
will go down to 3° C because it's in direct contact but look now the density

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,470
direct contact but look now the density is lower than the layers below which

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,230
is lower than the layers below which means it cannot sink it will keep

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,389
floating and these layers will not have a chance to keep come in contact with

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,069
a chance to keep come in contact with the surrounding layer and therefore

00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:42,269
the surrounding layer and therefore relatively they will stay warm pretty

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:45,150
relatively they will stay warm pretty close to 4° C and now as the temperature

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,990
close to 4° C and now as the temperature keeps dropping this is the layer that's

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,750
keeps dropping this is the layer that's whose temperature will keep dropping

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,430
whose temperature will keep dropping keeping the lower layers warm and

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,590
keeping the lower layers warm and eventually this layer will crystallize

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,750
eventually this layer will crystallize and now it doesn't matter how cold it

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,990
gets outside the lower layers are protected and this is why only the top

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,829
protected and this is why only the top of the water body tends to get Frozen

00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,710
of the water body tends to get Frozen and the bottom will stay relatively warm

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,350
and the bottom will stay relatively warm and it will stay in the liquid form it

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,560
and it will stay in the liquid form it allows Aquatic Life to exist
